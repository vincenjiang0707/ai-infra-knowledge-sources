#### AssetOpsBench

Benchmark asset operation performance in the browser

While existing AI benchmarks excel at isolated tasks such as coding or web navigation, they often fail to capture the complexity of real-world industrial operations. To bridge this gap, we introduce **AssetOpsBench**, a framework specifically designed to evaluate agent performance across six critical dimensions of industrial applications. Unlike traditional benchmarks, AssetOpsBench emphasizes the need for **multi-agent** coordination—moving beyond `lone wolf' models to systems that can handle complex failure modes, integrate multiple data streams, and manage intricate work orders. By focusing on these high-stakes, multi-agent dynamics, the benchmark ensures that AI agents are assessed on their ability to navigate the nuances and safety-critical demands of a true industrial environment.

AssetOpsBench is built for asset operations such as chillers and air handling units. It comprises:

Experts helped curate **150+** scenarios. Each scenario includes metadata: task type, output format, category, and sub-agents. The tasks designed span across:

AssetOpsBench evaluates agentic systems across six qualitative dimensions designed to reflect real operational constraints in industrial asset management. Rather than optimizing for a single success metric, the benchmark emphasizes decision trace quality, evidence grounding, failure awareness, and actionability under incomplete and noisy data.

Each agent run is scored across six criteria:

Across early evaluations, we observe that many general-purpose agents perform well on surface-level reasoning but struggle with sustained multi-step coordination involving work orders, failure semantics, and temporal dependencies. Agents that explicitly model operational context and uncertainty tend to produce more stable and interpretable trajectories, even when final task completion is partial.

This feedback-oriented evaluation is intentional: in industrial settings, understanding why an agent fails is often more valuable than a binary success signal.

A central contribution of AssetOpsBench is the explicit treatment of **failure modes** as first-class evaluation signals in agentic industrial workflows. Rather than treating failure as a binary outcome, AssetOpsBench analyzes full multi-agent execution trajectories to identify *where*, *how*, and *why* agent behavior breaks down under realistic operational constraints.

Failure analysis in AssetOpsBench is implemented through a dedicated trajectory-level pipeline (**TrajFM**), which combines LLM-based reasoning with statistical clustering to surface interpretable failure patterns from agent execution traces. This pipeline operates in three stages: (1) trajectory-level failure extraction using an LLM-guided diagnostic prompt, (2) embedding-based clustering to group recurring failure patterns, and (3) analysis and visualization to support developer feedback and iteration.

Across industrial scenarios, recurrent failure modes include:

Importantly, AssetOpsBench does not rely solely on a fixed, hand-crafted failure taxonomy. While a structured set of predefined failure categories (e.g., verification errors, step repetition, role violations) is used for consistency, the system is explicitly designed to **discover new failure patterns** that emerge in practice. Additional failure modes identified by the LLM are embedded and clustered automatically, allowing the taxonomy to evolve as new agent designs and behaviors are evaluated.

To preserve industrial confidentiality, raw execution traces are never exposed. Instead, agents receive aggregated scores across six evaluation dimensions together with clustered failure-mode summaries that explain *why* an agent failed, without revealing sensitive data or intermediate reasoning steps. This feedback-driven design enables developers to diagnose weaknesses, refine agent workflows, and iteratively resubmit improved agents.

This failure-aware evaluation reflects the realities of industrial asset management, where cautious, degradation-aware reasoning—and the ability to recognize uncertainty, defer action, or escalate appropriately—is often preferable to aggressive but brittle automation.

AssetOpsBench-Live is designed as an open, [competition-ready benchmark](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/10206/), and we welcome submissions of agent implementations from the community. Agents are evaluated in a controlled, privacy-preserving environment that reflects real industrial asset management constraints.

To submit an agent, developers first validate their implementation locally using a provided simulated environment, which includes representative sensor data, work orders, alerts, and failure-mode catalogs. Agents are then containerized and submitted for remote execution on hidden evaluation scenarios.

Submitted agents are evaluated across six qualitative dimensions—task completion, accuracy, result verification, action sequencing, clarity, and hallucination—using a consistent, reproducible evaluation protocol. Execution traces are not exposed; instead, participants receive aggregated scores and structured failure-mode feedback that highlights where and why an agent’s reasoning or coordination broke down.

This feedback-driven evaluation loop enables iterative improvement: developers can diagnose failure patterns, refine agent design or workflow structure, and resubmit updated agents for further evaluation. Both planning-focused and execution-focused agents are supported, allowing researchers and practitioners to explore diverse agentic designs within the same benchmark framework.

We performed a community evaluation where we tested two tracks:

Across 225 users and 300+ agents and leading open source models, here are the observations:

| Model Family | Best Planning Score | Best Execution Score | Key Limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
GPT-4.1 |
68.2 | 72.4 | Hallucinated completion on complex workflows |
Mistral-Large |
64.7 | 69.1 | Struggled with multi-hop tool sequences |
LLaMA-4 Maverick |
66.0 | 70.8 | Missed clarifying questions (fixable) |
LLaMA-3-70B |
52.3 | 58.9 | Collapsed under multi-agent coordination |


Note:None of the models could pass our evaluation criteria benchmark and get 85 points, which is the threshold for deployment readiness.

Across 881 agent execution traces, failure distribution was as follows:

Beyond this, 185 traces had one new failure pattern and 164 had multiple novel failures.

This is an exceptionally important and well-executed benchmark. The shift in focus from "did the task succeed?" to "how and why did the process fail?" is precisely what's needed to move AI agents from research demos into high-stakes industrial environments.

The six-dimensional evaluation framework and the TrajFM pipeline for analyzing failure modes are standout contributions. The data you've shared is striking—particularly that no tested model, including the top performers, could meet the 85-point deployment readiness threshold. This honest result highlights a critical maturity gap and sets a clear, high bar for the community.

The findings around multi-agent coordination are especially valuable. The significant accuracy drop from single-agent (68%) to multi-agent (47%) workflows quantifies a major challenge many have anecdotally observed but rarely measured so clearly.

I have a couple of questions based on the thoughtful analysis:

Evolving Failure Taxonomy: You mention the system is designed to discover new failure patterns beyond the predefined taxonomy. Have you observed any novel, recurrent failure modes emerging from the community evaluations that are now being considered for inclusion in the core taxonomy?

Measuring Coordination Quality: The benchmark effectively captures that multi-agent coordination fails. Are there plans to develop more granular metrics to diagnose the quality of coordination itself (e.g., communication efficiency, conflict resolution) as a distinct dimension?

Congratulations to the team on this crucial work. By providing a rigorous, feedback-driven, and privacy-preserving evaluation platform, AssetOpsBench doesn't just measure progress—it actively guides the field toward building more robust and trustworthy industrial agents.

This is an open source project and you are more than welcome to contribute to the thoughtful analysis you have provided -

Yes, for evolving failure mode, and we can add it to the core taxonomy.[@mcemri](https://huggingface.co/mcemri) / [@melissapan](https://huggingface.co/melissapan) Any suggestion?

wow

Good post, thanks :)

I’ve been using AssetOpsBench in the context of industrial multi-agent evaluation, and what stands out to me is not just the benchmark itself, but the shift in mindset it represents. We finally have a structured way to stress-test coordination, orchestration, and tool reliability in Industry 4.0-style environments, instead of relying on isolated task accuracy.

In my own exploration, I’ve been particularly interested in:

• Failure distributions across agent trajectories

• Tool precision and recovery dynamics

• Orchestration patterns under realistic industrial constraints

• Governance implications for enterprise deployment

I wrote a deeper technical perspective on this, especially through an Industry 4.0 and enterprise adoption lens. Kindly check it out:

always a very relevant topic for asset lifecycle management

AssetOpsBench is a fascinating approach to evaluating AI agents in real industrial environments. The focus on task completion, verification, hallucination, and failure awareness makes the benchmark especially valuable.
