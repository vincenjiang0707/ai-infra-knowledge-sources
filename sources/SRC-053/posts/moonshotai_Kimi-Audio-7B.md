## Introduction

We present Kimi-Audio, an open-source audio foundation model excelling in **audio understanding, generation, and conversation**. This repository hosts the model checkpoints for Kimi-Audio-7B.

Kimi-Audio is designed as a universal audio foundation model capable of handling a wide variety of audio processing tasks within a single unified framework. Key features include:

*   **Universal Capabilities:** Handles diverse tasks like speech recognition (ASR), audio question answering (AQA), audio captioning (AAC), speech emotion recognition (SER), sound event/scene classification (SEC/ASC) and end-to-end speech conversation.
*   **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Achieves SOTA results on numerous audio benchmarks (see our [Technical Report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Audio/master/assets/kimia_report.pdf)).
*   **Large-Scale Pre-training:** Pre-trained on over 13 million hours of diverse audio data (speech, music, sounds) and text data.
*   **Novel Architecture:** Employs a hybrid audio input (continuous acoustic + discrete semantic tokens) and an LLM core with parallel heads for text and audio token generation.
*   **Efficient Inference:** Features a chunk-wise streaming detokenizer based on flow matching for low-latency audio generation.

For more details, please refer to our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Audio) and [Technical Report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Audio/master/assets/kimia_report.pdf). 

## Note

Kimi-Audio-7B is a base model without fine-tuning. So it cannot be used directly.
The base model is quite flexible, you can fine-tune it on any possible downstream tasks.
