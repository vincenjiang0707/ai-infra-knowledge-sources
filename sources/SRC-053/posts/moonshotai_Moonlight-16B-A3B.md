## Abstract
Recently, the [Muon optimizer](https://github.com/KellerJordan/Muon) has demonstrated strong results in training small-scale language models, but the scalability to larger models has not been proven. We identify two crucial techniques for scaling up Muon:

- **Weight Decay**: Critical for scaling to larger models
- **Consistent RMS Updates**: Enforcing a consistent root mean square on model updates

These techniques allow Muon to work out-of-the-box on large-scale training without the need of hyper-parameter tuning. Scaling law experiments indicate that Muon is $\sim2\times$ more sample efficient than Adam with compute optimal training.

Based on these improvements, we introduce **Moonlight**, a 3B/16B-parameter Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) model trained with 5.7T tokens using Muon. Our model improves the current Pareto frontier, achieving better performance with much fewer training FLOPs compared to prior models.

We open-source our Muon implementation that is memory optimal and communication efficient. We also release the pretrained, instruction-tuned, and intermediate checkpoints to support future research.

Our code is available at [MoonshotAI/Moonlight](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Moonlight).

## Key Ingredients

Our work builds upon Muon while systematically identifying and resolving its limitations in large-scale training scenarios. Our technical contributions include:

- **Analysis for Effective Scaling of Muon**: Through extensive analysis, we identify that weight decay plays a crucial roles in Muon's scalability. Besides, we proposed to keep a consistent update root mean square (RMS) across different matrix and non-matrix parameters through parameter-wise update scale adjustments. Such adjustments significantly enhanced training stability.

- **Efficient Distributed Implementation**: We develop a distributed version of Muon with ZeRO-1 style optimization, achieving optimal memory efficiency and reduced communication overhead while preserving the mathematical properties of the algorithm.

- **Scaling Law Validation**: We performed scaling law research that compares Muon with strong AdamW baselines, and showed the superior performance of Muon (see Figure 1). Based on the scaling law results, Muon achieves comparable performance to AdamW trained counterparts while requiring only approximately 52% of the training FLOPs.

## Performance

We compared Moonlight with SOTA public models at similar scale:

- **LLAMA3-3B** is a 3B-parameter dense model trained with 9T tokens
- **Qwen2.5-3B** is a 3B-parameter dense model trained with 18T tokens  
- **Deepseek-v2-Lite** is a 2.4B/16B-parameter MOE model trained with 5.7T tokens

### Inference with Hugging Face Transformers 

We introduce how to use our model at inference stage using transformers library. It is recommended to use python=3.10, torch>=2.1.0, and transformers=4.48.2 as the development environment. 

For our pretrained model (Moonlight-16B-A3B):
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "moonshotai/Moonlight-16B-A3B"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True,
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)

prompt = "1+1=2, 1+2="
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True).to(model.device)
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100)
response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[0]
print(response)
```

For our instruct model (Moonlight-16B-A3B-Instruct):

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "moonshotai/Moonlight-16B-A3B-Instruct"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant provided by Moonshot-AI."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Is 123 a prime?"}
]
input_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
generated_ids = model.generate(inputs=input_ids, max_new_tokens=500)
response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[0]
print(response)
```

Moonlight has the same architecture as DeepSeek-V3, which is supported by many popular inference engines, such as VLLM and SGLang. As a result, our model can also be easily deployed using these tools.
