## 1. Introduction

Introducing DeepSeek-VL2, an advanced series of large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Vision-Language Models that significantly improves upon its predecessor, DeepSeek-VL. DeepSeek-VL2 demonstrates superior capabilities across various tasks, including but not limited to visual question answering, optical character recognition,  document/table/chart understanding, and visual grounding. Our model series is composed of three variants: DeepSeek-VL2-Tiny, DeepSeek-VL2-Small and DeepSeek-VL2, with 1.0B, 2.8B and 4.5B activated parameters respectively.
DeepSeek-VL2 achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance with similar or fewer activated parameters compared to existing open-source dense and MoE-based models.

### 2. Model Summary

DeepSeek-VL2 is built on DeepSeekMoE-27B.


## 3. Quick Start

### Installation

On the basis of `Python >= 3.8` environment, install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

### Notifications
1. We suggest to use a temperature T <= 0.7 when sampling. We observe a larger temperature decreases the generation quality.
2. To keep the number of tokens managable in the context window, we apply dynamic tiling strategy to <=2 images. When there are >=3 images, we directly pad the images to 384*384 as inputs without tiling.
3. The main difference between DeepSeek-VL2-Tiny, DeepSeek-VL2-Small and DeepSeek-VL2 is the base LLM.

### Simple Inference Example

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

from deepseek_vl.models import DeepseekVLV2Processor, DeepseekVLV2ForCausalLM
from deepseek_vl.utils.io import load_pil_images


# specify the path to the model
model_path = "deepseek-ai/deepseek-vl2-small"
vl_chat_processor: DeepseekVLV2Processor = DeepseekVLV2Processor.from_pretrained(model_path)
tokenizer = vl_chat_processor.tokenizer

vl_gpt: DeepseekVLV2ForCausalLM = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True)
vl_gpt = vl_gpt.to(torch.bfloat16).cuda().eval()

## single image conversation example
conversation = [
    {
        "role": "<|User|>",
        "content": "<image>\n<|ref|>The giraffe at the back.<|/ref|>.",
        "images": ["./images/visual_grounding.jpeg"],
    },
    {"role": "<|Assistant|>", "content": ""},
]

## multiple images (or in-context learning) conversation example
# conversation = [
#     {
#         "role": "User",
#         "content": "<image_placeholder>A dog wearing nothing in the foreground, "
#                    "<image_placeholder>a dog wearing a santa hat, "
#                    "<image_placeholder>a dog wearing a wizard outfit, and "
#                    "<image_placeholder>what's the dog wearing?",
#         "images": [
#             "images/dog_a.png",
#             "images/dog_b.png",
#             "images/dog_c.png",
#             "images/dog_d.png",
#         ],
#     },
#     {"role": "Assistant", "content": ""}
# ]

# load images and prepare for inputs
pil_images = load_pil_images(conversation)
prepare_inputs = vl_chat_processor(
    conversations=conversation,
    images=pil_images,
    force_batchify=True,
    system_prompt=""
).to(vl_gpt.device)

# run image encoder to get the image embeddings
inputs_embeds = vl_gpt.prepare_inputs_embeds(**prepare_inputs)

# run the model to get the response
outputs = vl_gpt.language_model.generate(
    inputs_embeds=inputs_embeds,
    attention_mask=prepare_inputs.attention_mask,
    pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
    bos_token_id=tokenizer.bos_token_id,
    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
    max_new_tokens=512,
    do_sample=False,
    use_cache=True
)

answer = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0].cpu().tolist(), skip_special_tokens=True)
print(f"{prepare_inputs['sft_format'][0]}", answer)
```
