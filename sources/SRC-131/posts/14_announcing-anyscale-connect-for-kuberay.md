If you run Ray on Kubernetes, you have probably already made your choices:[ KubeRay](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay) for the operator, Kueue or KAI for queueing, Argo CD for delivery, Kyverno for policy checks. That stack works, your team knows it, and your platform is built around it.

Until now, adopting the Anyscale Platform meant leaving those choices behind. The[ Anyscale Operator](https://github.com/anyscale/helm-charts) creates and manages Pods directly and does not understand KubeRay CRDs, so moving onto the platform meant rewriting your job specs, your GitOps repos, and the tooling wrapped around them.

Today we are introducing **Anyscale KubeRay Connect**, now in private preview. It removes that tradeoff: keep the KubeRay stack you already run, and get Anyscale's observability and orchestration on top of it. Your KubeRay Operator keeps reconciling your CRs exactly as it does today, and you keep submitting workloads the way you already do.

## LinkWhy Anyscale KubeRay Connect

The gap between Anyscale and the KubeRay ecosystem cuts in both directions. KubeRay Connect closes it from both.

### LinkOnboarding without migration

No migration, no CR rewrites. Previously, with no CRD support on the platform, your `RayJob`

, `RayService`

, and `RayCluster`

specs had no path onto Anyscale, teams had to translate everything into Anyscale YAML first.

Now an engineer can point the Anyscale Connector at a KubeRay cluster that is already running, and Anyscale layers observability, scheduling, and lifecycle management directly onto the CRs already there. Setup is a Helm chart considerably lighter than the Anyscale Operator.

### LinkInteroperability with the Kubernetes ecosystem

Rather than driving Pods directly, KubeRay Connect builds on KubeRay CRDs and leaves state reconciliation to the KubeRay Operator, which follows the standard Kubernetes controller architecture.

That distinction matters because of the large body of tooling built on top of Kubernetes native primitives like[ CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) and custom controllers. ](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/)Kueue integrates with Deployments and KubeRay CRDs; Argo CD and Kyverno work the same way. Under KubeRay Connect, all of it keeps working.

## LinkWhat it is

Instead of creating Pods, Anyscale mutates your existing KubeRay specs at admission, injecting lightweight dataplane sidecars that power observability. The product is structured in three tiers, and we are shipping them in order. Observe is the entry point, and deliberately the lowest-friction one.

## LinkArchitecture at a glance

Anyscale KubeRay Connect installs three Anyscale components into your dataplane.

**The Anyscale Connector** is responsible for control operations: syncing state between the Anyscale Platform and your cluster, and serving a MutatingWebhook that patches KubeRay CRs at admission. It is a Helm-installed Deployment, running on a single pod as of now.

The** Cluster Telemetry Gateway** is responsible for aggregating logs and metrics from your Ray workloads and ships them to the Anyscale control plane. It is an OpenTelemetry Collector, deployed with a small set of sidecars.

The **Observability API** runs as a Deployment and serves the telemetry surface the Anyscale console reads from.

Splitting control from telemetry is a deliberate choice. The first benefit is fault tolerance – the Connector is only needed at the beginning of a pod's lifecycle, to mutate the spec; after that it can crash without affecting any metrics already flowing. The reverse holds too — a telemetry failure has no effect on admitting new workloads. This separation also yields both security (a split in identity that prevents bad actors) and scalability benefits (concurrent operations trigger Kubernetes autoscaling independently).

Four properties come out of this design:

**Egress-only.**Every connection is initiated from your dataplane. The Anyscale control plane needs no ingress into your cluster, ever.**Kubernetes-native authentication.**The Connector authenticates with a projected service account OIDC token, verified against your cluster's own JWKS, removing the need for an Anyscale API key in the loop. This works on any conformant cluster whose OIDC issuer we can reach.**Resilient to control plane outages.**Ray workloads keep running and keep making progress even if the Anyscale control plane is unavailable.**Thin-shim Connector.**Control logic is pulled from the control plane rather than baked into the chart, so fixes and improvements can ship without you running a Helm upgrade.

The mutating webhook is** fail-closed by default**. If the Connector is unavailable when a KubeRay CR is submitted, the CR is rejected rather than admitted without telemetry wired up. We chose this over fail-open to avoid silently admitting workloads in an incomplete state. The behavior is configurable.

If the Connector fails *after* a workload is admitted, telemetry keeps flowing, the Gateway is independent of it. What you lose is the job state: the Connector is what reports phase transitions back to the platform, so a job moving from pending to running to terminated won't update in the console until the Connector recovers. The workload itself is unaffected.

## LinkWhat you get on day one

### LinkObservability

Once the telemetry gateway is flowing, you get the Anyscale observability out of the box for your KubeRay workloads, and it works whether you submit through `kubectl apply`

or through the Anyscale API:

**Ray workload dashboards**— Ray Data, Ray Train, and Cluster views, built for Ray**Task and actor dashboards**, which persist after the cluster terminates**Aggregated logs**via Loki, plus per-workload logs**Workspaces, service, and job events**, including autoscaler logs**Telescope**, with a new full-stack view spanning your hardware to your Ray applications, across your fleet

That last one is worth highlighting: Telescope now correlates signals from the hardware layer (DCGM) through Kubernetes infrastructure events all the way up to your Ray applications — so a slow training job and the failing GPU underneath it show up in the same place. We wrote about that work in more detail in our recent full-stack observability [post](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/anyscale-gpu-health-observability).** **

This is the observability tooling Anyscale has built into the platform, now available on KubeRay workloads in minutes.

### LinkOrchestration

The preview also covers workload submission, scheduling, and status tracking on Kubernetes:

**Submit KubeRay CRs directly**to the cluster with`kubectl apply -f job.yaml`

, or through the platform with`anyscale job submit -f job.yaml`

**Track job progress**, status, and retries from the Anyscale console**Queue**with Kueue, by applying Kueue configuration to your CRsQueue with the Anyscale Scheduler, in Kueue passthrough or layered mode —

*coming soon*

## LinkWhat's next

The private preview covers onboarding, observability, and single-cluster orchestration. From here we are working on:

**Multi-cluster orchestration.**The Orchestrate tier, using Observe's health and availability signals to place workloads across clusters.**Identity passthrough.**Mapping cluster identity to platform identity so RBAC, attribution, and quotas work on the cluster submission path.**For services, multi-region serving.**

## LinkGet started

Anyscale KubeRay Connect is in private preview. If you are running Ray on Kubernetes and want Anyscale without changing how you deploy, we would like to work with you.
