Replace the printf-to-head pipeline used to extract the user-authored PR content with sed. Unlike head, sed consumes the complete input and does not close the pipe early while printf is still writing a long PR body. Reported CI error: ./scripts/format_pr.sh: line 39: printf: write error: Broken pipe Error: Process completed with exit code 1. Tests: - tox -e lint-check - uv run --no-sync bash -c (50,000-line PR body extraction regression check) Assisted-by: Codex GPT-5 Signed-off-by: tangming1996 <ming.tang@daocloud.io>
