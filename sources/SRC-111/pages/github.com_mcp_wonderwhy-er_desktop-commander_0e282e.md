### Benefits of Docker Usage

**Complete isolation**from your host system**Consistent environment**across different machines**Easy cleanup**- just remove the container when done**Perfect for testing**new features or configurations

## URL Support

`read_file`

can now fetch content from both local files and URLs- Example:
`read_file`

with`isUrl: true`

parameter to read from web resources - Handles both text and image content from remote sources
- Images (local or from URLs) are displayed visually in Claude's interface, not as text
- Claude can see and analyze the actual image content
- Default 30-second timeout for URL requests

## File Preview UI & Markdown Editor

Desktop Commander includes a rich file preview widget in Claude Desktop that renders files visually as AI works with them.

### Supported file types

**Markdown**— rendered preview with a built-in editor**Images**— inline display (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, etc.)**Code files**— syntax-highlighted source view**HTML**— rendered preview with toggle to source view**Directories**— interactive tree with expand/collapse and lazy loading**PDF, Excel, DOCX**— native content extraction and display

### Markdown Editor

When viewing a `.md`

file in Claude Desktop, you can edit it directly inside the preview panel — no need to open a separate app.

**How to use:**

- Ask Claude to read or create a markdown file
- Expand the file preview to fullscreen using the
**⤢ Expand**button - The editor activates automatically in fullscreen mode
- Edit your content with a live preview toggle, copy, undo, and save controls
- Changes are saved back to disk; collapse to return to inline view

**Editor features:**

- Live
**edit / preview toggle**— switch between raw markdown and rendered output **Auto-save**to disk with save status indicator**Undo**support to revert unsaved changes**Copy**button to grab the full markdown source**Open in editor**— launch your default markdown app directly from the panel- Partial-file awareness — loads and merges surrounding lines when the file was only partially read
- Text selection context — select text in preview mode and the AI can reference your selection

### Directory Browser

When Claude runs `list_directory`

, the result opens as an interactive file tree inside the preview panel — not just raw text output.

**Features:**

**Expandable tree**— folders expand and collapse on click; top-level contents shown immediately**Lazy loading**— subfolders load on demand to keep the initial view fast**Large directory handling**— directories with many items show a`⚠ click to load all`

button instead of overwhelming the view**Open in Finder/Explorer**— each folder has a quick-open button to reveal it in your file manager**Click to preview**— clicking any file in the tree opens it in the file preview panel directly**Back navigation**— after opening a file from the tree, a ← Back button returns you to the directory view

### Other preview features

**Expand / collapse**— toggle between compact summary row and full panel**Open in folder**— reveal the file in Finder/Explorer with one click**Load more lines**— incrementally load content above or below a partial read window**Text selection**— highlight text in any preview; the AI can see and reference your selection

## Fuzzy Search Log Analysis (npm scripts)

The fuzzy search logging system includes convenient npm scripts for analyzing logs outside of the MCP environment:

```
# View recent fuzzy search logs
npm run logs:view -- --count 20
# Analyze patterns and performance
npm run logs:analyze -- --threshold 0.8
# Export logs to CSV or JSON
npm run logs:export -- --format json --output analysis.json
# Clear all logs (with confirmation)
npm run logs:clear
```

For detailed documentation on these scripts, see [scripts/README.md](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP/blob/main/scripts/README.md).

## Fuzzy Search Logs

Desktop Commander includes comprehensive logging for fuzzy search operations in the `edit_block`

tool. When an exact match isn't found, the system performs a fuzzy search and logs detailed information for analysis.

### What Gets Logged

Every fuzzy search operation logs:

**Search and found text**: The text you're looking for vs. what was found**Similarity score**: How close the match is (0-100%)**Execution time**: How long the search took**Character differences**: Detailed diff showing exactly what's different**File metadata**: Extension, search/found text lengths**Character codes**: Specific character codes causing differences

### Log Location

Logs are automatically saved to:

**macOS/Linux**:`~/.claude-server-commander-logs/fuzzy-search.log`

**Windows**:`%USERPROFILE%\.claude-server-commander-logs\fuzzy-search.log`


### What You'll Learn

The fuzzy search logs help you understand:

**Why exact matches fail**: Common issues like whitespace differences, line endings, or character encoding**Performance patterns**: How search complexity affects execution time**File type issues**: Which file extensions commonly have matching problems**Character encoding problems**: Specific character codes that cause diffs

## Local Tool History and Audit Logs

Desktop Commander keeps tool-call records **locally on the machine running the MCP server**. These local files are separate from optional telemetry and are not a server-side historical audit log.

`claude_tool_call.log`

— local argument log

Every tool call handled by the local MCP server is appended as a text line containing an ISO timestamp, the tool name, and the JSON-serialized arguments. Arguments are **not redacted or sanitized before being written to this local file**, so it may contain command text, file paths, or other sensitive values passed to tools. Tool outputs are not written to this file.

The active file rotates when it reaches 10 MB. The previous file is renamed using a timestamp, for example `claude_tool_call_2026-09-07_14-32-10.log`

, and a new `claude_tool_call.log`

is created. Rotated files are not automatically deleted by the logger.

Locations:

**macOS/Linux**:`~/.claude-server-commander/claude_tool_call.log`

**Windows**:`%USERPROFILE%\.claude-server-commander\claude_tool_call.log`


`tool-history.jsonl`

— recent tool-call history

Desktop Commander also keeps a JSON Lines history used by `get_recent_tool_calls`

. Each record contains the timestamp, tool name, arguments, duration, and the returned result. This history is loaded from disk on startup, so recent history can survive an MCP server restart.

To keep this history bounded:

- At most the most recent 1,000 calls are kept in memory.
- Stored output is capped at 4 KiB per record; larger outputs are replaced with an omission marker.
- The on-disk file is trimmed when it grows beyond 5 MiB, keeping roughly the newest 4 MiB.
- On startup, a history with more than 2,000 records is rewritten to the most recent 1,000 records.
`get_recent_tool_calls`

and`track_ui_event`

are excluded from this JSONL history.

Locations:

**macOS/Linux**:`~/.claude-server-commander/tool-history.jsonl`

**Windows**:`%USERPROFILE%\.claude-server-commander\tool-history.jsonl`


### Remote calls and server-side retention

Calls executed through Remote Desktop Commander are still handled by the local MCP server and use the same local history files above. The Remote Desktop Commander service temporarily stores tool arguments and results in `mcp_remote_calls`

so calls can be routed and completed. Terminal rows are automatically swept shortly after completion (eligible for deletion after one minute, with a one-hour creation-time backstop), so they are not kept as a long-term historical server-side audit trail.

These local history files are also separate from Desktop Commander's optional telemetry. The files themselves are not uploaded as telemetry. See [Data Collection & Privacy](https://github.com#data-collection--privacy) and [PRIVACY.md](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP/blob/main/PRIVACY.md) for telemetry details.

## Handling Long-Running Commands

For commands that may take a while:

## Configuration Management

⚠️ Important Security Warnings


For comprehensive security information and vulnerability reporting: See[SECURITY.md]

-
**Known security limitations**: Directory restrictions and command blocking can be bypassed through various methods including symlinks, command substitution, and absolute paths or code execution -
**Always change configuration in a separate chat window**from where you're doing your actual work. Claude may sometimes attempt to modify configuration settings (like`allowedDirectories`

) if it encounters filesystem access restrictions. -
**The**, not terminal commands. Terminal commands can still access files outside allowed directories.`allowedDirectories`

setting currently only restricts filesystem operations -
**For production security**: Use the[Docker installation](https://github.com#option-6-docker-installation-%F0%9F%90%B3-%E2%AD%90-auto-updates-no-nodejs-required)which provides complete isolation from your host system.

### Configuration Tools

You can manage server configuration using the provided tools:

```
// Get the entire config
get_config({})
// Set a specific config value
set_config_value({ "key": "defaultShell", "value": "/bin/zsh" })
// Set multiple config values using separate calls
set_config_value({ "key": "defaultShell", "value": "/bin/bash" })
set_config_value({ "key": "allowedDirectories", "value": ["/Users/username/projects"] })
```

The configuration is saved to `config.json`

in the server's working directory and persists between server restarts.

#### Understanding fileWriteLineLimit

The `fileWriteLineLimit`

setting controls how many lines can be written in a single `write_file`

operation (default: 50 lines). This limit exists for several important reasons:

**Why the limit exists:**

**AIs are wasteful with tokens**: Instead of doing two small edits in a file, AIs may decide to rewrite the whole thing. We're trying to force AIs to do things in smaller changes as it saves time and tokens**Claude UX message limits**: There are limits within one message and hitting "Continue" does not really work. What we're trying here is to make AI work in smaller chunks so when you hit that limit, multiple chunks have succeeded and that work is not lost - it just needs to restart from the last chunk

**Setting the limit:**

```
// You can set it to thousands if you want
set_config_value({ "key": "fileWriteLineLimit", "value": 1000 })
// Or keep it smaller to force more efficient behavior
set_config_value({ "key": "fileWriteLineLimit", "value": 25 })
```

**Maximum value**: You can set it to thousands if you want - there's no technical restriction.

**Best practices**:

- Keep the default (50) to encourage efficient AI behavior and avoid token waste
- The system automatically suggests chunking when limits are exceeded
- Smaller chunks mean less work lost when Claude hits message limits

### Best Practices

-
**Create a dedicated chat for configuration changes**: Make all your config changes in one chat, then start a new chat for your actual work. -
**Be careful with empty**: Setting this to an empty array (`allowedDirectories`

`[]`

) grants access to your entire filesystem for file operations. -
**Use specific paths**: Instead of using broad paths like`/`

, specify exact directories you want to access. -
**Always verify configuration after changes**: Use`get_config({})`

to confirm your changes were applied correctly.

## Command Line Options

Desktop Commander supports several command line options for customizing behavior:

### Disable Onboarding

By default, Desktop Commander shows helpful onboarding prompts to new users (those with fewer than 10 tool calls). You can disable this behavior:

```
# Disable onboarding for this session
node dist/index.js --no-onboarding
# Or if using npm scripts
npm run start:no-onboarding
# For npx installations, modify your claude_desktop_config.json:
{
"mcpServers": {
"desktop-commander": {
"command": "npx",
"args": [
"-y",
"@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander@latest",
"--no-onboarding"
]
}
}
}
```

**When onboarding is automatically disabled:**

- When the MCP client name is set to "desktop-commander"
- When using the
`--no-onboarding`

flag - After users have used onboarding prompts or made 10+ tool calls

**Debug information:**

The server will log when onboarding is disabled: `"Onboarding disabled via --no-onboarding flag"`


## Using Different Shells

You can specify which shell to use for command execution:

```
// Using default shell (bash or system default)
execute_command({ "command": "echo $SHELL" })
// Using zsh specifically
execute_command({ "command": "echo $SHELL", "shell": "/bin/zsh" })
// Using bash specifically
execute_command({ "command": "echo $SHELL", "shell": "/bin/bash" })
```

This allows you to use shell-specific features or maintain consistent environments across commands.

`execute_command`

returns after timeout with initial output- Command continues in background
- Use
`read_output`

with PID to get new output - Use
`force_terminate`

to stop if needed

## Debugging

If you need to debug the server, you can install it in debug mode:

```
# Using npx
npx @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander@latest setup --debug
# Or if installed locally
npm run setup:debug
```

This will:

- Configure Claude to use a separate "desktop-commander" server
- Enable Node.js inspector protocol with
`--inspect-brk=9229`

flag - Pause execution at the start until a debugger connects
- Enable additional debugging environment variables

To connect a debugger:

- In Chrome, visit
`chrome://inspect`

and look for the Node.js instance - In VS Code, use the "Attach to Node Process" debug configuration
- Other IDEs/tools may have similar "attach" options for Node.js debugging

Important debugging notes:

- The server will pause on startup until a debugger connects (due to the
`--inspect-brk`

flag) - If you don't see activity during debugging, ensure you're connected to the correct Node.js process
- Multiple Node processes may be running; connect to the one on port 9229
- The debug server is identified as "desktop-commander-debug" in Claude's MCP server list

Troubleshooting:

- If Claude times out while trying to use the debug server, your debugger might not be properly connected
- When properly connected, the process will continue execution after hitting the first breakpoint
- You can add additional breakpoints in your IDE once connected

## Model Context Protocol Integration

## Frequently Asked Questions

Here are answers to some common questions. For a more comprehensive FAQ, see our [detailed FAQ document](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP/blob/main/FAQ.md).

### What is Desktop Commander?

It's an MCP tool that enables Claude Desktop to access your file system and terminal, turning Claude into a versatile assistant for coding, automation, codebase exploration, and more.

### How is this different from Cursor/Windsurf?

Unlike IDE-focused tools, Claude Desktop Commander provides a solution-centric approach that works with your entire OS, not just within a coding environment. Claude reads files in full rather than chunking them, can work across multiple projects simultaneously, and executes changes in one go rather than requiring constant review.

### Do I need to pay for API credits?

No. This tool works with Claude Desktop's standard Pro subscription ($20/month), not with API calls, so you won't incur additional costs beyond the subscription fee.

### Does Desktop Commander automatically update?

Yes, when installed through npx or Smithery, Desktop Commander automatically updates to the latest version when you restart Claude. No manual update process is needed.

### What are the most common use cases?

- Exploring and understanding complex codebases
- Generating diagrams and documentation
- Automating tasks across your system
- Working with multiple projects simultaneously
- Making surgical code changes with precise control

## Data Collection & Privacy

Desktop Commander collects limited, pseudonymous telemetry to improve the tool. We do not collect file contents, file paths, or command arguments as telemetry.

This is separate from the [local tool history and audit logs](https://github.com#local-tool-history-and-audit-logs), which stay on the machine running Desktop Commander and may contain tool arguments and bounded result previews.

**Opt-out:** Ask Claude to "disable Desktop Commander telemetry" or set `"telemetryEnabled": false`

in your config.
