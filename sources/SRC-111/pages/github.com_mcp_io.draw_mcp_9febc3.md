# Draw.io MCP Server

The official [draw.io](https://www.draw.io) MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables LLMs to create and open diagrams in the draw.io editor.

## Four Ways to Create Diagrams

This repository offers four approaches for integrating draw.io with AI assistants. Pick the one that fits your setup:

The MCP App server renders draw.io diagrams **inline** in AI chat interfaces using the [MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/extensions/apps) protocol. Instead of opening a browser tab, diagrams appear directly in the conversation as interactive iframes.

The official hosted endpoint is available at:

```
https://mcp.draw.io/mcp
```


Add this URL as a remote MCP server in Claude.ai, Cursor, or any MCP Apps-compatible host — no installation required. On Claude.ai, draw.io is also listed in the [connector directory](https://claude.ai/directory/pending-draw-io) and can be added from there in one click. In Cursor (≥ 2.6), diagrams render inline in the Agent chat ([one-click install](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=drawio&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5kcmF3LmlvL21jcCJ9)); on older builds, use the stdio [ @drawio/mcp](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-mcp/blob/main/mcp-tool-server/README.md) tool server instead.

You can also run the server locally via Node.js or the [ jgraph/drawio-mcp](https://hub.docker.com/r/jgraph/drawio-mcp) Docker image, or deploy your own instance to Cloudflare Workers.

**Tools:**

— Renders draw.io XML as an interactive diagram inline in chat`create_diagram`

— Searches 10,000+ shapes across all draw.io libraries (AWS, Azure, GCP, P&ID, electrical, Cisco, Kubernetes, UML, BPMN, etc.) by keyword, supplemented by the draw.io icon service (brand logos and general-purpose concept icons) when the built-in libraries have no good match. Returns exact style strings that can be used directly in XML. Use this to find the correct shape before calling`search_shapes`

`create_diagram`

.


Note:Inline diagram rendering requires an MCP host that supports the MCP Apps extension. In hosts without MCP Apps support, the tool still works but returns the XML as text.

## MCP Tool Server

The original MCP server that opens diagrams directly in the draw.io editor. Supports XML, CSV, and Mermaid.js formats with lightbox and dark mode options. Published as [ @drawio/mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@drawio/mcp) on npm.

Quick start: `npx @drawio/mcp`


Setup instructions are available for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, VS Code (GitHub Copilot), Cursor (with one-click install), and OpenCode.

## Assistant Plugins (Claude Code, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot)

The `drawio`

skill packaged as a plugin for AI coding assistants (under [ plugins/](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-mcp/blob/main/plugins/README.md)): it generates native

`.drawio`

files, with optional export to PNG, SVG, or PDF (with embedded XML so the exported file remains editable in draw.io) — or a browser URL that opens the diagram directly in `app.diagrams.net`

. No MCP setup required. The same skill ships for three hosts:**Claude Code** ([full documentation →](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-mcp/blob/main/plugins/claude-code/README.md)) — install from this repo's marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add jgraph/drawio-mcp
/plugin install drawio@drawio
```


Or load it directly from a local clone with `claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/claude-code`

.

**Codex CLI** ([full documentation →](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-mcp/blob/main/plugins/codex/drawio/README.md)) — install from the same marketplace repo:

```
codex plugin marketplace add jgraph/drawio-mcp
codex plugin add drawio@drawio
```

**GitHub Copilot CLI** ([full documentation →](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-mcp/blob/main/plugins/copilot/README.md)) — install from the same marketplace repo:

```
copilot plugin marketplace add jgraph/drawio-mcp
copilot plugin install drawio@drawio
```

Other Copilot surfaces (VS Code agent mode, the coding agent, code review) load the same skill from a repo's `.github/skills/`

directory instead — see the [plugin README](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-mcp/blob/main/plugins/copilot/README.md).

**OpenCode** needs no plugin at all: it discovers skills in `.opencode/skills/`

and `.claude/skills/`

(and their `~/`

equivalents), so the Claude Code skill folder works as-is — see [OpenCode (no plugin needed)](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-mcp/blob/main/plugins/README.md#opencode-no-plugin-needed) for the one-line install.

By default, the plugin writes a `.drawio`

file and opens it in draw.io. Mention a format in your request to change the output:

**png / svg / pdf**— exports using the draw.io desktop CLI with`--embed-diagram`

**url**— compresses the XML with Node.js's built-in`zlib`

and opens the result at`app.diagrams.net`

. No draw.io Desktop needed; the`.drawio`

file is kept locally as a persistent copy.

## Alternative: Project Instructions (No MCP Required)

An alternative approach that works **without installing anything**. Add instructions to a Claude Project that teach Claude to generate draw.io URLs using Python code execution. No MCP server, no desktop app — just paste and go.

## Diagram layouts

Two optional, independent layout passes can run after the AI generates a diagram — one re-arranges the nodes, the other only reroutes the edges. Which are available depends on the approach:

| Layout pass | What it does | App Server (`create_diagram` ) |
Tool Server (`open_drawio_xml` ) |
Assistant Plugins | Project Instructions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
ELK auto-layout (`postLayout: "elk"` ) |
Re-arranges nodes into a clean layered layout; routes the edges as part of it | ✅ | — | ✅ via draw.io Desktop CLI (`--layout` ) |
— |
libavoid routing (`routing: "libavoid"` ) |
Keeps node positions; reroutes connectors orthogonally around the shapes |
✅ | ✅ from v1.3.0 |
✅ via draw.io Desktop CLI (`--layout libavoid` ) |
— |

- These apply to
**draw.io XML**diagrams.**Mermaid**diagrams are auto-laid-out already, so neither pass is needed. - The
**App Server**applies these in the inline viewer after the diagram renders; the**Tool Server**applies libavoid server-side before opening the draw.io editor; the**plugins**run them through the locally installed draw.io Desktop CLI. - Pick one, not both: ELK already routes its own edges, so adding libavoid on top is redundant. Use
`postLayout`

to re-arrange a layout, or`routing`

to tidy the connectors on a layout you placed deliberately.

## Data Residency & Offline Use

If you're deploying in an environment with strict data restrictions, here is exactly

where diagram data goes for each approach.

**No component sends your diagram to a cloud rasterizer.** `convert.diagrams.net`

(or

any cloud export endpoint) is not called anywhere in this repository, and there is no

"local dependency missing → fall back to cloud" path. PNG/SVG/PDF export happens only

in the assistant plugins, which shell out to your **locally installed draw.io Desktop CLI**

(located via `which drawio`

); if it isn't installed, the `.drawio`

file is kept and

nothing is sent.

### Does your diagram leave the machine?

| Approach | Diagram leaves the machine? |
|---|---|
MCP App Server — hosted (`mcp.draw.io` ) |
Yes — it is sent to the draw.io server as the MCP request. Self-host instead (below) to keep it local. |
MCP App Server — self-hosted (local Node, the `jgraph/drawio-mcp` Docker image, or your own Cloudflare) |
No — processed by your server and embedded in HTML that renders client-side. |
MCP Tool Server (`@drawio/mcp` ) |
No — carried in the URL `#fragment` , which browsers do not transmit to the server. |
Assistant Plugins (Claude Code, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot) |
No — written locally and exported by your local draw.io Desktop CLI. |

By default the servers do not write diagram content to their logs — only request

metadata (method, session, status, timing). The Cloudflare-hosted App Server logs

response bodies only when run with `DEBUG=true`

.

### Reducing external requests

Even when the diagram itself stays local, the rendering loads draw.io's web-app /

viewer **code** from `app.diagrams.net`

and `viewer.diagrams.net`

by default. These

fetch application code and assets — not your diagram — but they are still outbound

requests. To reduce or remove them:

**App Server:**build with the`VIEWER_PATH`

environment variable to inline the

viewer instead of loading it from`viewer.diagrams.net`

. Server-side, it makes a

version check against`viewer.diagrams.net`

at startup and daily (no data, 5 s

timeout, safe to block), and`search_shapes`

queries`icons.diagrams.net`

with the

search terms unless`DRAWIO_ICON_SERVICE_URL=off`

.**Tool Server:**set the`DRAWIO_BASE_URL`

environment variable to a self-hosted

draw.io instance. Its two server-side passes also fetch**code**from

`viewer.diagrams.net`

once per draw.io release and cache it per user: the libavoid

routing core (`routing: "libavoid"`

, also primed at install time) and the

drawio-elk bundle (`postLayout: "elk"`

, fetched on first use, overridable with

`DRAWIO_ELK_URL`

). Not requesting those passes makes no such call; the diagram is

never part of one either way.**Assistant Plugins:**the opt-in`url`

output mode opens the diagram at

`app.diagrams.net`

(hardcoded — no`DRAWIO_BASE_URL`

equivalent). Use the default

`.drawio`

output or local Desktop export instead if you need to avoid that request.

### Your LLM is a separate consideration

The diagram is *generated* by the LLM. If you use a hosted model, the diagram content

is produced in that provider's cloud regardless of where this MCP server runs.

End-to-end isolation requires a locally hosted model as well.

### Verifying

The only reliable way to confirm a deployment makes **no** outbound calls is to run it

with network egress blocked (or watch the browser's Network tab) and verify it still

renders. We recommend this for any strict-isolation deployment.

## XML Reference (Single Source of Truth)

The draw.io XML generation reference — covering edge routing, containers, layers, tags, metadata, dark mode, style properties, and XML well-formedness — lives in a single canonical file:

All four approaches above use this file as their single source of truth for LLM prompts:

| Approach | How it accesses the reference |
|---|---|
| MCP App Server | Reads the file at startup / build time and includes it in the tool description |
| MCP Tool Server | Reads the file at startup (from repo or bundled copy via `prepack` ) |
| Assistant Plugins (Claude Code, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot) | Reference the
|

When updating XML generation guidance, edit only `shared/xml-reference.md`

— changes propagate to all consumers automatically.

## Shape Search Index

The `search_shapes`

tool is powered by a pre-built index of all draw.io shapes. The index is generated from the live draw.io client (`https://app.diagrams.net/js/app.min.js`

) by running all sidebar palette initializations in Node.js via jsdom and capturing the shape data.

Icons from the draw.io icon service (`icons.diagrams.net`

— the same grouped icon search the editor sidebar uses) are **not** part of this index: `search_shapes`

queries the service live when the local index has no strong match for a query, returning the icons as `shape=image`

styles. Set `DRAWIO_ICON_SERVICE_URL`

to a self-hosted service to override the endpoint, or to `off`

to disable icon supplementation.

`shape-search/search-index.json`

is committed to the repository and is **automatically refreshed on every draw.io release** via the [Update Shape Search Index](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-mcp/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-search-index.yml) GitHub Action — no manual step is required to stay in sync with the latest shapes.

To regenerate the index manually (e.g. when iterating on the generator itself):

```
cd shape-search
npm install
npm run generate
# Rebuild the MCP App Server worker to embed the updated index
cd ../mcp-app-server
npm run build:worker
```

The generator fetches `app.min.js`

directly from the public draw.io web app, so no local checkout of the draw.io source is needed.
