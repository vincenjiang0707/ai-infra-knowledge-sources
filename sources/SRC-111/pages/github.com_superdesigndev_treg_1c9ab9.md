**OpenRouter, but for agent tools instead of models.** Point an agent at one base URL with one token
and it can do the job: **3,000+ catalogued endpoints across 60+ providers** — SEO and backlinks,
social and trends, people and company enrichment, ads, scraping, image and video generation —
**priced per call, from a cent**,
with no provider signup. Plus your own team's keys, skills and CLIs, callable by every teammate's
agent without the credential ever leaving the server.

**Ask for the task, not the tool.** You do not need to know which vendor sells backlink data, or to
hold an account with them. Search for what you want to do, read the price, call it.

Built for the Superdesign team, live at [treg.to](https://treg.to) — anyone can self-host.

The tools an agent needs for real work sit behind subscriptions nobody buys for a single run — Semrush $139/mo, Moz $99/mo, Crunchbase $99/mo, Apollo $59/seat — behind signup walls, or behind no public API at all (invite-only, partner-only, app-review-only). treg carries those accounts and bills fractions of a cent per call.

**The catalog**— external endpoints treg can serve with its own key or through a verified public route that needs no provider key. Own-key calls use the team's prepaid balance; anonymous calls are free. No account with the provider is needed. New verified accounts receive**$1.00 free**once, when they create an eligible team.**Your own tools**— anything a teammate registered: a paid API account, an OAuth connection, a vendor CLI, a`SKILL.md`

.**Your own key always wins over treg's, and those calls are never metered.**

The vocabulary for the second half:

**tool**= something the registry calls for you with the org's credential. Two kinds:**endpoint**— an upstream`base_url`

+ credential**bindings**(each binding injects one secret into the request; a request can carry several, e.g. an OAuth bearer*and*a`developer-token`

header).**CLI**— a vendor binary (`stripe`

,`gh`

,`vercel`

, ...) run with the credential injected.

**skill / bundle**= a recipe (`SKILL.md`

) + its secrets + its tool(s), registered together.

**The one rule:** the proxy **relays, never models** the upstream, and **injects auth server-side**
— so it survives upstream API changes and callers never hold keys.

Visit [ treg.to](https://treg.to) (hosted on Render) — the dashboard,
sign-in, and every URL below live there.

Same flow as the dashboard's **Getting started** guide:

```
# 1. install the CLI — also points it at the registry
curl -fsSL https://treg.to/install.sh | sh
# 2. sign in (GitHub default · --email for a one-time code · --token for agents/CI)
treg login
# 3. do something useful immediately — no key, nothing registered
treg catalog search "backlinks for a domain" # find a tool by what it DOES
treg call tikhub.tiktok.user.profile --query uniqueId=tiktok
treg balance # exactly what that cost
# (or `treg onboard` for the guided walkthrough)
```

Fish Audio provides S2.1 Pro speech, public-voice discovery, and private voice cloning.
Speech is binary stdout, so redirect it to a file. A discovered voice's `_id`

or a team voice id is
the TTS `reference_id`

; voices created on treg's Fish account are durable team resources:

```
treg call fishaudio.tts.s2-1-pro --method POST --header model=s2.1-pro \
--data '{"text":"Hello from treg","format":"mp3"}' > speech.mp3
treg call fishaudio.voices.discover --query self=false --query licensed=false --query language=en
treg resources list --provider fishaudio --kind voice
```

With your own Fish key, requests remain an unrestricted, unmetered upstream relay and Fish owns the account boundary.

Catalog tool inputs are described by `treg catalog get <id>`

. Tools marked `strict_query`

reject undeclared or repeated query parameters, unsupported values and request bodies.

Your token identifies you on every call (`X-Treg-Token`

header) and is the same for all tools.
Discover what your team has shared: `treg tool ls`

· check credential health: `treg health`

.

```
/plugin marketplace add superdesigndev/treg
/plugin install treg@treg
```


Installs with no token and no configuration. The skill loads as `treg:treg`

and, on its first run,
walks your agent through the rest — the CLI, sign-in, then `treg mcp install`

— so you end up with
the command line **and** treg's tools. Other agents: `npx skills add superdesigndev/treg -s treg`

(the `-s`

matters — without it you also get this repo's internal dev skills).
See [docs/CLAUDE-PLUGIN.md](https://github.com/superdesigndev/treg/blob/main/docs/CLAUDE-PLUGIN.md). MiniMax Code / MiniMax Agent users: the same
skill ships via the MiniMax Plugin Marketplace ([docs/MINIMAX-PLUGIN.md](https://github.com/superdesigndev/treg/blob/main/docs/MINIMAX-PLUGIN.md)).

The Claude Connectors Directory surface is `https://treg.to/mcp/v2/`

. It exposes only curated
catalog endpoints and separates read calls from write calls so Claude receives accurate safety
signals. The existing `/mcp/`

surface remains available for catalog endpoints, team-owned tools,
and imported skills. See the [MCP and OAuth architecture](https://github.com/superdesigndev/treg/blob/main/docs/context/architecture/mcp-oauth.md)
for the boundary and implementation, and the
[submission runbook](https://github.com/superdesigndev/treg/blob/main/docs/CLAUDE-CONNECTOR-SUBMISSION.md) for release gates.

The catalog is grouped by what endpoints **do**: keyword and rank tracking, backlinks and authority,
AI visibility, trending and discovery, publishing to socials, people and company enrichment, ads
management and creative, measurement.

```
treg catalog # every platform, busiest first
treg catalog search "find a work email" # by the job, not the vendor
treg catalog get hunter.people.email.find # params, PRICE, example response
treg call hunter.people.email.find --query domain=reddit.com --query full_name="Alexis Ohanian"
```

**How a catalogued call is served** — the credential ladder, in order:

- your team registered its own tool for that provider → that tool, that key;
- your team stored a secret for the provider → injected through a virtual tool;
- neither, and the endpoint has a verified public route →
**no provider key**, free; - otherwise →
**treg's own key**, billed to the team's prepaid balance.

The anonymous price assumes the caller does not send a provider credential header. The faithful
relay preserves caller headers, so a caller-supplied provider key can use that key's credits.
Your own credential always beats treg's, so connecting a key you already pay for makes those calls
free of the balance rather than duplicating them. An endpoint treg has no published price for is
**refused**, not served free — you are told to connect your own key instead. Where several providers
serve one capability, `treg catalog search`

shows them side by side with prices; **choosing is
yours** — treg does not silently pick or fail over between providers for you. (When treg's own
account for a provider is out it may serve the *same* endpoint through a treg-owned relay account,
disclosed on the response; a team can opt out.) The exception you opt into: `treg.<capability>`

routed endpoints, where treg picks the provider for you and names it.

```
treg balance # credit left, calls in flight, recent spend
treg topup # add funds, or set up automatic top-ups
```

Out of balance is an HTTP **402** carrying `balance_micro`

, `estimated_cost_micro`

and a `topup_url`

,
so an agent can act on it without reading prose.

**Enrich Arena** lives at `/enrich-arena`

, outside the dashboard. Compare enrichment answers with each vendor’s cost and speed,
vote for the best answer in one click, or watch a sequential waterfall. Capability-compatible
async providers participate too; Arena handles submit and polling internally. Browsing is
public; submitting requires login, and billable attempts use your team's credits. See the
[Arena guide](https://github.com/superdesigndev/treg/blob/main/docs/context/interface/enrich-arena.md).

The zero-thought path — point treg at a project and it figures out what's shareable:

```
treg scan # read-only preview: the keys, skills & CLIs upload would register
treg upload # register them (encrypted server-side); idempotent, --replace to update
```

`treg upload`

scans the `.env`

(matching keys against ~80 known providers), every skill
subdirectory, and installed catalog CLIs. Three kinds of things go into the registry — here's how
to share and use each:

**Share** — one upstream URL callable with a stored key, or bulk from a `.env`

:

```
treg secret add STRIPE_KEY --value sk_live_123
treg add stripe --base-url https://api.stripe.com --secret STRIPE_KEY
treg upload env --select openai,stripe,resend # or straight from the .env
```

**Use** — the agent-native way: build the **real** upstream request and prefix it with the proxy.
treg resolves the tool by host, injects the credential, and relays everything else faithfully
(your `X-Treg-Token`

is stripped before the upstream sees it):

```
Real request: GET https://api.intercom.io/conversations?per_page=5
Through treg: GET https://treg.to/call/https://api.intercom.io/conversations?per_page=5
header: X-Treg-Token: <your token>
```


Or the CLI shorthand — and `treg calls`

for the audit log:

```
treg call intercom conversations --query per_page=5
treg call stripe v1/balance
```

**Share** — automatic: `treg upload`

detects installed catalog CLIs (`stripe`

, `gh`

, `vercel`

, …)
and registers them; a recipe-only catalog CLI skill (e.g. `stripe-cli`

) auto-becomes runnable too.

**Use** — `treg run`

executes the vendor CLI **with the org's credential injected**, so you never
hold the key or log in:

```
treg run stripe -- get /v1/balance
treg run gh -- pr list
treg run --server agentmail-cli inboxes list # runs on the registry server: the key never reaches you
```

`--local`

(default) runs on your machine; `--server`

runs on the registry and streams output back.
For a whole session, `treg shell start`

opens a subshell where every registered CLI injects
automatically — just use `stripe`

, `gh`

, … normally; `exit`

reverts. `treg runs`

is the audit log.

**Share** — a skill is a whole capability (`SKILL.md`

recipe + its secrets + its tool(s)),
registered together so the whole team runs the same skill, maintained in one place:

`treg upload skills --dir ~/.claude/skills --all # register a folder of skills in one pass`

**Use** — pull any shared skill into your agent; its API calls go through treg with your token,
so the key stays on the server, never in the skill:

`treg skill install seo-blog-writer # writes into ./.claude/skills/ (--all for the library)`

```
# multi-credential tool (e.g. google-ads: OAuth bearer + a developer-token header)
treg tool add google-ads --base-url https://googleads.googleapis.com \
--bind "secret=<oauth-id>,injector=oauth" \
--bind "secret=<dev-id>,name=developer-token,format={secret}"
# one skill, step by step
treg skill init --dir ./my-skill # drafts treg.json (guesses base_url, finds secrets)
treg skill add --dir ./my-skill # registers recipe + secrets + tool, atomically
# OAuth via the browser (mints the first token, treg holds it and auto-refreshes)
treg oauth connect gsc --client-secret client_secret.json \
--scopes https://www.googleapis.com/auth/webmasters.readonly
```

Full options for every command: [ USAGE.md](https://github.com/superdesigndev/treg/blob/main/USAGE.md).

The CLI sends anonymous command usage to PostHog when using treg.to (no arguments or credentials).
Disable with `TREG_TELEMETRY=0`

or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`

.
See [analytics details](https://github.com/superdesigndev/treg/blob/main/USAGE.md#anonymous-usage-analytics).

An account can own up to 10 teams. Joining other teams as a member does not count toward this limit.

Everything is scoped to an **org**: a token = a `(user, org)`

membership, and every secret, tool,
and skill belongs to the active org. Roles: **owner / admin / member / viewer**.

```
treg org create "Acme" # make a team, become owner
treg org invite teammate@acme.com # invite by email (pick role + tool access)
treg org join <code> --email you@acme.com # accept an invite (creates you if new)
treg org ls | use <slug> | members # switch orgs, see the roster
treg org access <member> --tools a,b # per-member tool access (admin+)
```

**Feedback:**`treg feedback submit friction "The pagination example is unclear."`

Share problems or suggestions without private information. See[feedback instructions](https://treg.to/feedback.md). -
**Review:**`treg review CALL_ID useful`

Rate an invited catalog call after using its result;`not_sure`

is fine. Omit private data and continue the task. -

**The dashboard**at[treg.to](https://treg.to)— full CRUD, a guided tutorial (Help → Tutorial), and copyable setup instructions for your agents. -
**The API**— everything the CLI does is plain HTTP; interactive OpenAPI docs live at`/docs`

. The proxy endpoint is`/call/{...}`

; all endpoints take the`X-Treg-Token`

header.

One command (needs `tmux`

+ [ uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); it syncs the venv itself):

`scripts/dev-local.sh up # server on http://localhost:18790, dev-safe settings`

That runs the server in tmux with hot-reload, its own sqlite DB (`treg-dev.db`

), and email OTP dev
mode (sign-in codes shown on the page — no mail sender needed). Day-to-day:

```
scripts/dev-local.sh cli login # sandboxed CLI: never touches your real ~/.treg/config.json
scripts/dev-local.sh logs # server output · status / restart / down
scripts/dev-local.sh reset # wipe the dev DB + CLI sandbox for a fresh start
```

Or run the server directly, without tmux:

```
bash scripts/build-dashboard.sh # Node 22.12+ and npm; build the Dashboard
uv sync # create the venv from uv.lock (pulls the server deps for dev)
uv run python -m treg upgrade # prepare schema + run idempotent release tasks without serving
uv run python -m treg # serve on 0.0.0.0:18790 (add --reload for dev)
uv run python -m treg keygen # print a fresh Fernet key for TREG_SECRET_KEY
```


Installing to run a server (not from source):the base package is theCLI only. To run a registry, install the server extra —`pip install "tools-registry[server]"`

— which adds FastAPI, the database drivers, and encryption.`pip install tools-registry`

alone gives just the`treg`

command for talking to an existing registry.

The official hosted service is available at `treg.to`

. Its production topology and live settings are
maintained in the private [operator runbook](https://github.com/superdesigndev/treg-internal/blob/main/docs/production/deploy.md).

**Request flow for /call:** resolve tool (by URL host + longest

prefix, or by name) →
decrypt its secret(s) → apply each binding's injector → stream to the upstream → fire-and-forget
audit record. The infra relay streams bytes without business logic. The call application buffers
responses needing settlement or ownership evidence up to 8 MiB; larger responses return a 502
without charging instead of a truncated success. Authorized free final downloads needing no body
evidence stream in full, as do own-key and own-tool responses.**Module map** (`src/treg/`

**The 4 auth shapes** (per binding `injector`

): `env`

(plain string / API key) · `secret_file`

(a
JSON token file, pull a field) · `oauth`

(a JSON OAuth token, auto-refreshed if refreshable) ·
`cli_auth`

(material lifted from a CLI's keychain).

**Faithful-relay contract:** the proxy alters **only** three things, everything else is verbatim:

- hop-by-hop transport headers (re-derived per hop),
- treg's own control + edge-forwarding headers (
`x-treg-token`

,`x-treg-org`

,`ngrok-skip-browser-warning`

,`x-forwarded-*`

,`via`

, …) and treg's session cookie — all stripped, never leak upstream, - the injected credential(s).

**OAuth, three ways to get the first token:** *manual upload* (drop in a `token.json`

) ·
*auto-refresh* (if the token carries `refresh_token`

+ client creds, treg keeps it fresh, you never
re-upload) · *hosted connect flow* (`treg oauth connect`

→ browser consent → treg captures the
token itself).

**Health checks:** give a tool an optional probe (`{method, path, expect_status}`

); a periodic run
(on demand or via cron) validates every credential, refreshes OAuth, and webhooks the owner of any
that break.
