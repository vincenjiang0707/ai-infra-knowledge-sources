# Developer Instructions

## Python Environment & Development Tools

See [the contributing guide](https://github.com/oraios/serena/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on setting up your development environment

and tools for formatting and type checking.

## Release Process

-
Ensure clean git status.

-
Set the version for release. Normally, the version to be released is the one already reserved by the


current`.dev0`

version (e.g.`1.8.0`

when the repository is at`1.8.0.dev0`

):`python scripts/bump_version.py release current`

To release a version beyond the reserved one, name the part to bump instead, e.g.

`python scripts/bump_version.py release patch python scripts/bump_version.py release minor`

This updates

`CHANGELOG.md`

, commits the release version, creates the git tag, and then

commits the subsequent`.dev0`

version for the next iteration. -
Push to GitHub:

`git push git push --tags`

Important: This must push a single tag only!


Pushing the single tag triggers the`create-release`

workflow for the tag, which creates a

**draft release**on GitHub. -
Review the draft release on the


[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/oraios/serena/releases).

When ready, publish it (click*Publish release*).

This triggers the`publish`

workflow, which builds and publishes the

package to PyPI.

### Bumping the Development Version

Independently of a release, the development version can be bumped, e.g. when work on `main`


begins to target a new minor or major version:

```
python scripts/bump_version.py dev minor
python scripts/bump_version.py dev major
```


This sets the version to the respective new `.dev0`

version (e.g. `1.8.0.dev0`

) and commits it as

"Set version to vX"; it creates no tag and does not modify `CHANGELOG.md`

.

The subsequent release of that version is then performed with `release current`

.

Both commands require a clean git status and support `--dry-run`

to preview the changes.
