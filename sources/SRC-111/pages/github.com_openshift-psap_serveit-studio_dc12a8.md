**Automated LLM inference optimization for Kubernetes**

Find the optimal vLLM configuration for your hardware, model, and workload — automatically.

ServeIt Studio deploys real vLLM instances on your cluster, sweeps configurations across aggregated, prefill/decode disaggregated (PD), and expert parallel (EP) architectures, tunes engine parameters from first principles, and returns the optimal setup — ranked by TTFT, throughput, or both.

[Screenshots](https://github.com#screenshots)[How It Works](https://github.com#how-it-works)[Workload Configuration](https://github.com#workload-configuration)[Prerequisites](https://github.com#prerequisites)[Deployment](https://github.com#deployment)[AI-Assisted Deployment](https://github.com#ai-assisted-deployment)[Network Types & Prerequisites](https://github.com#network-types--prerequisites)[Metrics](https://github.com#metrics)[Project Structure](https://github.com#project-structure)[License](https://github.com#license)

Manage multiple clusters and optimization instances from a single dashboard. Each cluster shows GPU nodes, VRAM, RDMA capability, and running instances.

Deploy a new optimization instance to any cluster. Select GPU count, storage class, and pin to specific nodes.

Select from response time, throughput, balanced, or architecture-specific strategies. Each goal tests different architectures and applies different optimization heuristics.

Browse and select from popular open-source LLM models. Filter by size category, architecture (Dense, MoE, Code, Speculative), and quantization format.

Review your full configuration summary — deployment, workload, and tuning settings — then start the automated optimization pipeline. Live console output shows progress in real time.

Interactive scatter plot showing every tested configuration. Bubble size represents GPU count. The ideal configuration is in the top-left corner (low latency + high throughput). Hover over any bubble to see the exact configuration details.

TTFT, throughput, and inter-token latency (ITL) across all tested prefill/decode splits. The green dot marks the best TTFT, the pink diamond marks the best throughput. Aggregated baseline shown as dashed reference lines.

Before running full benchmarks, the optimizer sweeps all valid Tensor Parallelism values to find which TP works best for each role. Lower TP means fewer GPUs per pod — allowing more replicas and higher total throughput. Higher TP reduces latency for large models but uses more GPUs per pod. The decode sweep measures tokens/s/GPU efficiency and inter-token latency (ITL), while the prefill sweep measures tokens/s/GPU and time-to-first-token (TTFT). The optimal TP for each role is selected from these results and used for all subsequent tests.

Estimate how many GPUs you need for a different workload without re-running tests. Adjust concurrency, ISL/OSL, and set a latency SLA — the estimator scales your tested results and shows which configurations meet the target and how many GPUs each would need.

ServeIt Studio supports three inference architectures:

| Architecture | Description | Optimizes For |
|---|---|---|
Aggregated |
Single vLLM deployment (baseline) | Simplicity |
Prefill/Decode (PD) |
Separate prefill and decode pods with KV cache transfer via NIXL/RDMA | Response time (TTFT) |
Expert Parallelism (EP) |
PD disaggregation with expert-parallel flags for MoE models | Throughput |

The optimizer selects which architectures to test based on the goal:

**Response Time**— Aggregated vs PD**Throughput**— Aggregated vs EP**Balanced**— All three**Aggregated Only / PD Only / EP Only**— Test a single architecture

| Mode | Config Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Response Time | `ttft` |
Optimize for lowest TTFT. Tests Aggregated vs PD. |
| Throughput | `throughput` |
Optimize for max req/s. Tests Aggregated vs EP. |
| Full Coverage | `balanced` |
Test all architectures, find best for both metrics. |
| Aggregated Only | `aggregated_only` |
Only test aggregated configs. |
| PD Only | `pd_only` |
Only test prefill/decode disaggregated configs. |
| EP Only | `ep_only` |
Only test expert parallel configs (MoE models). |
| Single Test | `single_test` |
Run one exact user-specified config (architecture, TP, pods). |

**Prerequisite Infrastructure**— Deploy gateway, EPP, RBAC, RDMA discovery**Decode TP Sweep**— Deploy aggregated vLLM at each TP (1, 2, 4, 8), measure decode TPSG**Prefill TP Sweep**— Same for prefill workloads (often different optimal TP)**Cluster Capacity Analysis**— Calculate GPU cost per request, sustainable throughput**GPU Sizing & Feasible Splits**— Enumerate valid P/D GPU divisions respecting TP constraints**Aggregated Configuration Search**— Test all aggregated configs (TP1×16R, TP2×8R, etc.)**P/D / EP Split Optimization**— Test selected splits, find Pareto front (or best throughput for EP)**Architecture Comparison**— Compare best PD/EP vs best Aggregated (no new tests)**EPP Tuning**— Smart EPP weight derivation from Prometheus metrics (optional)**Latency-Bounded Throughput**— Binary search for max throughput under latency SLA (optional)**Calibrated Load Validation**— Re-test at sustainable QPS computed via Little's Law (optional)

Steps 2-3 and 6-11 deploy real workloads. Steps 4-5 are pure math.

**Additional steps (after the main pipeline):**

**Concurrency Sweep**— Re-test top configs at multiple concurrency levels (e.g., 20, 30, 40, 60, 80) to map the performance curve. Shows exactly where each config starts to degrade.**Cache Hit Sweep**— Test different prefix cache hit ratios on best configs (optional).**EPP Smart Tuning**— Derive optimal routing weights from measured metrics (optional).

**Config from HuggingFace**— Reads`config.json`

for model size, dtype, MoE detection, hybrid attention, FP8 compatibility. Handles multimodal nested configs, interleaved MoE layers, and compressed-tensors quantization**Per-role min TP**— Computes minimum TP separately for prefill and decode from model weights + overhead + KV cache, with quantization-aware weight multipliers**TP compatibility filters**— Auto-excludes invalid TP values based on model architecture: attention head divisibility, Mamba SSM group count (`n_groups`

), FP8 block quantization shard size, and NVFP4 Marlin kernel alignment**Kernel compatibility**— Detects quantization strategy (per-channel vs per-tensor FP8) and configures compute kernels accordingly**Hybrid attention detection**— Detects hybrid architectures (Mamba-transformer, sliding window) and configures KV cache management for PD mode**Auto-disable flags**— Automatically disables model-specific flags (expert parallelism, tool-call parsers) when the model doesn't support them

**gpu_memory_utilization**— Profiled from actual VRAM usage after model load, or estimated from model size and GPU capacity. Always computed and passed (even when auto-tune is off) to prevent OOM from template defaults**max_num_seqs**— Multi-factor formula:`min(S_activation, S_kv, S_concurrency, 512)`

— adapts per model architecture and quantization**max_num_batched_tokens**— Computed from measured prefill TPSG × target batch latency**block_size**— Auto-tuned from sequence length:`next_power_of_2(sqrt(ISL+OSL))`

, min 128 for PD (KV block transfer)**moe_dp_chunk_size**— Smart formula for EP decode:`min(S_seq, S_expert_capacity, S_dispatch, 512)`

**kv_cache_memory_bytes**— Profiled decode KV cache budget from calibration memory data**DBO threshold**— Scaled by expert count: 32 for 128+ experts, 48 for 32+, 64 for smaller MoE

**Adaptive PD Search**— Tests the calibration-based ideal split first, then uses live vLLM metrics (per-pod`num_requests_waiting`

ratio) to iteratively rebalance prefill/decode pod counts. Converges in 1-4 tests per TP pair instead of testing 5+ precomputed splits blindly**Smart EPP weights**— Two-pass refinement: start from preset, adjust ±1 based on Prometheus metrics (prefix cache hit rate, queue depth, KV utilization), then refine with A/B guardrail**Pareto front**— Identifies configurations where no other config has both lower TTFT AND higher throughput**Calibrated load**— Per-architecture concurrency computed via Little's Law from measured throughput and response time**Latency-bounded search**— Binary search for maximum throughput under a TTFT SLA constraint**Asymmetric TP**— Prefill and decode can use different TP sizes in both directions (e.g., Prefill TP8 / Decode TP4 or vice versa). Disabled by default to reduce search space; enable via the "Allow Asymmetric TP" toggle**Cache hit sweep**— Tests performance at multiple prefix cache hit ratios (0-100%) on the best configs. Supports Identical, Shared Prefix, and Multi-Group cache modes. Optional calibrated concurrency

**MultiConnector**— Wraps NixlConnector (P/D KV transfer) + OffloadingConnector (CPU/disk offload) for disaggregated serving with KV cache offloading. Prefill uses`kv_producer`

, decode uses`kv_consumer`

.**CPU KV cache offload**— Offload KV cache to CPU DRAM via OffloadingConnector with`lazy_offload`

. Extends cacheable working set beyond GPU HBM for long agentic sessions.**Disk KV cache offload**— Offload KV cache to local NVMe via TieringOffloadingSpec. Uses hostPath volume when local disk is available.**Bidirectional KV transfer**— Enable bidirectional KV transfer for models that benefit from it (e.g., agentic serving with long context reuse).

**Disagg-aware profiles**— Separate prefill and decode scheduling profiles with independent scorer chains. Prefill profile uses`token-load-scorer`

+`prefix-cache-affinity-filter`

, decode profile uses`active-request-scorer`

.**Preset + Custom**— Choose from presets (`balanced`

,`cache_optimized`

,`queue_balanced`

,`latency_aware`

) or configure individual plugin weights.**New plugins**—`token-load-scorer`

,`prefix-cache-affinity-filter`

(with`peakPrefillThroughput`

),`inflight-load-producer`

,`active-request-scorer`

.

**Multi-cluster launcher**— Manage optimization instances across multiple Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters from a single dashboard**Resume**— Resume interrupted runs from the last completed test. Per-architecture resume skips completed architectures, not the entire step**Artifact management**— Download raw test artifacts (guidellm JSON, Prometheus metrics, manifests, configs) per test**Database persistence**— All results, configs, and metrics stored in SQLite with full run history. Resume, compare, and reuse across sessions**GPU Estimator**— Scale tested results to different workloads (ISL, OSL, concurrency, turns) without re-running tests. Shows GPU requirements for SLA targets**Report analytics**— Interactive Plotly charts: Pareto front, PD configuration sweep with ITL subplot, throughput vs latency scatter, GPU efficiency, TP calibration, calibrated load analysis, EPP weight comparison, run comparison**MLflow integration**— Export test results to MLflow with params, metrics, and artifacts. Per-user workspace targeting, descriptive run names, and tags for model, llm-d version, architecture, and cluster**Downloadable reports**— HTML and raw artifact download for offline analysis and sharing**Prefix cache simulation**— Generate multi-group prefix cache datasets with configurable hit rate, group count, and seed for reproducible workloads**Wide-EP support**— Dynamic multi-port targetPorts on InferencePool, data-parallel sidecar and vLLM ports, supervisor port for DP > 1**Pod error detection**— Auto-detects OOM, CUDA errors, and crash loops during tests; KV transfer errors logged as warnings (non-critical). Stops on critical errors, preserves pods for investigation**Guidellm retry**— Retries guidellm up to 3 times on 2-4% error rate while pods are still running, avoiding expensive redeploy cycles. Stops with actionable guidance on >2% overload (503s)**Speculative decoding**— Auto-detects MTP-capable models and compares performance with and without speculative decoding**Stop at any time**— Stop checks at every stage of test execution (before deploy, after deploy, during model load, before benchmark)**Vanilla Kubernetes support**— Prometheus auto-discovery via in-cluster DNS (no OpenShift required). Automatic port-forward fallback for external access.**Container image management**— Direct image inputs for engine, EPP router, and routing sidecar. Fetch tags from any registry. Quick buttons for upstream vLLM versions.**Block size control**— Three modes: Auto (ServeIt computed), Default (vLLM auto-detection), Custom.**Turn dataset generator**— Pre-generates multi-turn conversation datasets using guidellm's SyntheticTextDataset for consistent, reusable workloads across tests.

ServeIt Studio supports guidellm's full synthetic workload configuration:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| ISL / OSL | Average input/output sequence length (tokens) |
| ISL/OSL stdev | Standard deviation for lognormal distribution |
| ISL/OSL min/max | Hard token count limits |
| Turns | Multi-turn conversations (1 = single-turn) |
| First Prompt Tokens | Override first turn prompt length (e.g., 160K for agentic repo context) |
| Prefix Tokens | Shared system prompt (cached across conversations) |
| Prefix Count | Number of unique prefixes (1 = max cache reuse) |
| Inter-Turn Delay | Tool call latency simulation (mean/stdev/min/max seconds) |
| Concurrency | Number of concurrent users/sessions |

GuideLLM accumulates conversation history across turns — each turn sends all previous prompts and responses as context. Combined with `first_prompt_tokens`

for large initial context and `turn_delay`

for tool call pauses, this simulates real agentic workloads:

```
Turn 1: [3K prefix] + [160K first_prompt] → heavy prefill
Turn 2: [3K prefix] + [160K] + [425 response] + [1500 new prompt] → cached context reuse
Turn N: accumulated history grows ~1925 tokens/turn
```


Replicating the llm-d Nemotron agentic serving benchmark:

```
{
"isl": 1500, "osl": 425,
"first_prompt_tokens": 160000,
"prefix_tokens": 3000, "prefix_count": 1,
"turns": 540,
"turn_delay": 15, "turn_delay_stdev": 55, "turn_delay_min": 1, "turn_delay_max": 100
}
```

- Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster with NVIDIA GPUs
[LeaderWorkerSet](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws)CRD installed- Gateway API CRDs + a gateway provider (
[Istio](https://istio.io/), Cilium Gateway, or similar) `kubectl`

(or`oc`

) CLI configured- Optional: Prometheus (auto-discovered for vLLM/DCGM metrics collection)
- Optional: HuggingFace token (for gated models)

```
# 1. Create the namespace
kubectl create namespace serveit
# 2. Deploy ServeIt Studio (launcher mode)
python3 deployment/deploy.py --mode launcher --storage-class <your-class> -n serveit
# 3. Access the UI
python3 deployment/deploy.py --port-forward -n serveit
# Opens http://localhost:8080
```

On OpenShift, a Route is created automatically:

`oc get route -n serveit`

| Mode | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
Launcher (default) |
`--mode launcher` |
Multi-user dashboard. Create instances per cluster, each with its own optimization environment |
Standalone |
`--mode local` |
Single-instance deployment. Direct access to the optimization wizard |

```
# Deploy with an existing PVC (skip PVC creation)
python3 deployment/deploy.py --pvc-name my-existing-pvc -n serveit
# Sync code to all running pods (after git pull)
python3 deployment/deploy.py --sync-all -n serveit
# Restart the server process
python3 deployment/deploy.py --restart-server -n serveit
# Generate YAML without deploying (for review or GitOps)
python3 deployment/deploy.py --just-yaml --storage-class <your-class> -n serveit
```

The launcher supports optimizing models on remote clusters. When creating a new instance, upload a kubeconfig for the target cluster. ServeIt Studio will:

- Validate connectivity to the remote cluster
- Store the kubeconfig as a Kubernetes Secret
- Deploy workload pods (vLLM, guidellm, EPP) on the remote cluster
- Collect results back to the launcher's database

The wizard pod runs on the launcher cluster; only the inference workload runs remotely.

ServeIt Studio includes skills for **Claude Code** and **Cursor** that automate the entire deployment and optimization flow through a guided conversation. The AI assistant walks you through cluster setup, model selection, workload configuration, and monitors the optimization — no need to memorize CLI flags or API calls.

**Claude Code:**

```
# Copy the skill to your Claude Code skills directory
cp -r AI-assistance/serveit-run ~/.claude/skills/serveit-run
# Then invoke it in Claude Code
/serveit-run
```

The AI assistant guides you through:

**Deployment mode**— choose between local (single instance) or launcher (multi-tenant with backup/restore, resource limits, multi-cluster)**Cluster scanning**— auto-detects GPUs, RDMA, storage classes, networking, and installed infrastructure**Model selection**— helps choose from the 700+ model gallery based on your use case, or validates a specific model**Workload configuration**— explains ISL/OSL in plain language with real-world examples, prefix caching modes, and concurrency**Advanced tuning**— search depth, latency SLAs, production load analysis, EPP routing, vLLM engine settings**Infrastructure**— auto-detects networking (DRA, SR-IOV, NAD), storage (hostpath-nvme, NFS, block), container images**Execution**— saves config, locks UI, starts optimization via REST API, monitors progress**Results**— fetches best configs, presents summary, offers manifest downloads

All operations use the REST API (`docs/api-reference.md`

) — no Socket.IO dependency for the AI-driven flow.

Full REST API documentation is available at [ docs/api-reference.md](https://github.com/openshift-psap/serveit-studio/blob/main/docs/api-reference.md), covering:

- Cluster scanning, storage setup, optimization lifecycle
- Config lock/unlock for API-driven workflows
- Run management, chart data, manifest downloads
- MLflow export, database backup/restore

ServeIt Studio supports five network types for GPU-to-GPU communication. The wizard auto-detects available types and lets you choose. Each type has different cluster prerequisites:

Standard Kubernetes pod networking. No RDMA — uses TCP for all GPU communication. Works everywhere but significantly slower for multi-node inference.

**Prerequisites:** None. Always available.

Network Attachment Definitions via [Multus CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni). Supports host-device, macvlan, and SR-IOV plugins for RDMA.

**Prerequisites:**

- Multus CNI installed (
`k8s.cni.cncf.io`

API group available) - NetworkAttachmentDefinition CRs created in the workload namespace
- For SR-IOV:
[SR-IOV Network Operator](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-operator)installed with:`SriovNetworkNodePolicy`

configured by admin (VFs on physical NICs)`SriovNetwork`

CR targeting the workload namespace (ServeIt Studio can create this)


[Dynamic Resource Allocation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/) with GPU+NIC PCIe affinity. Automatically pairs each GPU with its closest network interface.

**Prerequisites:**

- Kubernetes 1.31+ with DRA feature gate enabled
[DRANET](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dranet)device classes deployed`dra.llm-d.io/gpu-nic-pair`

or`gpu.nvidia.com`

device classes available

RDMA via [NVIDIA Network Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/cokan10/network+operator) device plugin. Pods request RDMA resources directly in `limits`

— no Multus annotations or CRDs needed.

**Prerequisites:**

- NVIDIA Network Operator (NNO) installed
- NicClusterPolicy configured with
`rdmaSharedDevicePlugin`

- RDMA resources visible in node allocatable (e.g.,
`rdma/roce_gdr`

,`nvidia.com/roce`

,`rdma/ib`

) - MOFED drivers loaded on GPU nodes

RoCE RDMA via SR-IOV Virtual Functions. Each pod gets dedicated network interfaces for GPU-aware RDMA routing. Supports both [multi-nic-cni](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/multi-nic-cni) (auto-creates NADs per namespace) and manual SR-IOV operator setup.

**Prerequisites:**

[SR-IOV Network Operator](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-operator)installed`SriovNetworkNodePolicy`

configured by admin (creates VFs on physical NICs)- One of:
**multi-nic-cni operator**installed → auto-creates`multi-nic-inference`

/`multi-nic-compute`

NADs in every namespace**Manual setup**→`SriovNetwork`

CR created per NIC targeting the workload namespace (ServeIt Studio can create these via the wizard)

`rdma/roce_gdr`

or similar RDMA resources in node allocatable

The wizard scans the cluster and shows available network types as cards. When SR-IOV or NAD is selected:

**NAD dropdown**— pick which NetworkAttachmentDefinition to attach to pods**SR-IOV policy checkboxes**— select which NICs to use (each creates a separate interface)

When Shared Device Plugin is selected:

**RDMA resource dropdown**— pick which device plugin resource to request (e.g.,`rdma/roce_gdr`

vs`nvidia.com/roce`

)

HTTPS proxy is supported for clusters behind corporate firewalls — configure it when adding the cluster in the launcher.

**Client-side** (via [guidellm](https://github.com/vllm-project/guidellm)):

- TTFT (p50, p90, p95, p99)
- Inter-token latency (ITL)
- Throughput (requests/sec)
- TPOT (time per output token)

**Server-side** (via Prometheus/Thanos):

- vLLM TTFT, ITL, E2E latency percentiles
- Token throughput, request queue depth, KV cache utilization
- Prefix cache hit rate, preemption rate, request success rate

Results are stored in SQLite at `/mnt/storage/serveit.db`
