Basicmachines Co Basic Memory

By [basicmachines-co](https://github.com/basicmachines-co)·4,031

Local-first knowledge management with bi-directional LLM sync via Markdown files.

## Skip the install — try Basic Memory in the cloud

Claude, Codex, or Cursor connected in 30 seconds. No Python, no JSON, no

terminal. **$15.00/mo locked in for life** (12.50/mo yearly pricing). 7-day free

trial — cancel any time before day 7 if it's not for you. Beta pricing —

sign up now and your rate never goes up. OSS users: code `BMFOSS`

takes

another 20% off for 3 months.

### Basic Memory Teams is now available!

Give your team a single, shared cloud workspace. Knowledge isn't confined to one person — anything a teammate writes is immediately available to everyone else and to their AI assistants.

Edit a note together in real time, hand work off between humans and agents, and build one connected knowledge base instead of scattered copies. Same pricing - start with one user and add more as needed.

# Basic Memory

### Your AI never forgets again.

Pick up right where you left off — in Claude, Codex, Cursor, ChatGPT, or

anything that speaks [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Your knowledge

lives as Markdown files that both you and your AI can read, write, and

search.

**Local-first.**Plain text on your disk. Forever.**Two-way.**AI and humans write to the same files; sync keeps them in step.**A real knowledge graph.**Observations and wikilinks compound into context.**Semantic search.**Find notes by meaning, not just keywords, with optional

cross-encoder reranking for higher-quality vector and hybrid results.**MCP-native.**Works with every major AI client and IDE.**Progressive tool discovery.**Every tool is tagged with behavior hints

(read-only, destructive, idempotent) so agents pick the right tool on

demand — no wasted context trying things to see what they do.**Cloud, optional.**Sync across devices when you want — never required.

## Get started

Pick the path that fits you. Both run the same product on the same Markdown.

| ☁️ Cloud | 💻 Local install |
|---|---|
|
|
`uv tool install basic-memory --prerelease=allow`
For Postgres deployments that store semantic vectors in Milvus, install the `uv tool install "basic-memory[milvus]" --prerelease=allow` |

## What people are saying

Basic Memory changed my whole relationship with LLMs. I switched from GPT


and Gemini to exclusively Claude and Claude Code because of this

integration and am completely revamping all our company's processes around

a Basic Memory workflow.—

Alex, TrainerDay

Basic Memory is the missing 'wow' factor in AI chatbots. Now I can't


imagine Claude or Claude Code without it.—

Caleb, Caleb Picker Consulting

I don't code without Basic Memory anymore. It's such a time saver to be


able to refer to projects I don't currently have active and keep a running

log of all my learnings and ProTips.—

, Developer[@groksrc]

[VS Code](https://github.com#vs-code)[ChatGPT](https://github.com#chatgpt)`search`

/ `fetch`

)[Obsidian](https://github.com#obsidian)## Official agent packages

This repository is also the canonical home for Basic Memory's host-native

agent packages. The core Python package, Claude Code plugin, shared skills,

Hermes plugin, and OpenClaw plugin all ship from the same source tree.

Maintainers can verify the whole consolidated surface from the repo root:

`just package-check`

Package-local justfiles are also available when working inside one host:

```
just package-check-claude-code
just package-check-skills
just package-check-hermes
just package-check-openclaw
```

### Claude Code plugin

The Claude Code plugin is the bridge between Claude's working memory and Basic

Memory — session-start briefings, pre-compaction checkpoints, an opt-in capture

output style, and `/basic-memory:bm-setup`

· `:remember`

· `:share`

· `:status`

.

**Connect the Basic Memory MCP server first** — see [Connect your AI
client](https://github.com#connect-your-ai-client). The plugin's hooks and skills call it, so it's a

hard prerequisite. Then install the plugin:

`bm install claude-code`

That registers the marketplace and installs the plugin through Claude Code. Add

`--scope project`

to declare both in the repository's settings for a team, or

`--dry-run`

to see the underlying `claude plugin`

commands without running them.

Source: [ plugins/claude-code](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/blob/main/plugins/claude-code).

### Shared skills

Framework-agnostic `SKILL.md`

files live in [ skills/](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/blob/main/skills). If your

Skills CLI supports repository subdirectory sources:

`npx skills add basicmachines-co/basic-memory/skills`

If your installed Skills CLI cannot load that source, update the CLI or copy

the `memory-*`

directories from `skills/`

into your agent's skills directory.

### Hermes

Hermes keeps its native plugin shape under [ integrations/hermes](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/blob/main/integrations/hermes):

`hermes plugins install basicmachines-co/basic-memory/integrations/hermes`

Hermes does not install a plugin's Python dependencies, so also add the `mcp`


package to the Hermes venv — see the [plugin README](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/blob/main/integrations/hermes/README.md#install)

for that step and the supported Hermes releases.

### OpenClaw

OpenClaw stays package-native and publishes from

[ integrations/openclaw](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/blob/main/integrations/openclaw):

`openclaw plugins install @basicmemory/openclaw-basic-memory`

## Pick up where you left off

[https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a55d8238-8dd0-454a-be4c-8860dbbd0ddc](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a55d8238-8dd0-454a-be4c-8860dbbd0ddc)

## Connect your AI client

If you went the [Cloud](https://github.com#get-started) route, the web app walks you through

client connect. The snippets below are for local installs.

### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

:

```
{
"mcpServers": {
"basic-memory": {
"command": "uvx",
"args": ["--prerelease=allow", "basic-memory", "mcp"]
}
}
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Notes live in `~/basic-memory`

by default.

**Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, VS Code, ChatGPT, Obsidian**

### Claude Code

`claude mcp add basic-memory -- uvx --prerelease=allow basic-memory mcp`

For the full memory bridge — session briefings, pre-compaction checkpoints, and

the `/basic-memory:*`

commands — also install the [Claude Code
plugin](https://github.com#claude-code-plugin) on top of this.

### Codex CLI

Add to `~/.codex/config.toml`

:

```
[mcp_servers.basic-memory]
command = "uvx"
args = ["--prerelease=allow", "basic-memory", "mcp"]
```

Codex can keep its default MCP approval behavior, or you can pre-approve eligible

Basic Memory tools by adding this server-scoped setting to the same table:

```
[mcp_servers.basic-memory]
command = "uvx"
args = ["--prerelease=allow", "basic-memory", "mcp"]
default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"
```

This does not disable Codex approvals globally or expand which Basic Memory

projects the server can access. Codex still requires approval for tools that

advertise a destructive annotation, including Basic Memory's writes, edits, and

deletes. If you installed the Basic Memory Codex plugin, use its

[plugin-scoped configuration](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/blob/main/plugins/codex/README.md#mcp-approvals) instead.

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`

(project) or `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

(global):

```
{
"mcpServers": {
"basic-memory": {
"command": "uvx",
"args": ["--prerelease=allow", "basic-memory", "mcp"]
}
}
}
```

### VS Code

Add to your User Settings (JSON):

```
{
"mcp": {
"servers": {
"basic-memory": {
"command": "uvx",
"args": ["--prerelease=allow", "basic-memory", "mcp"]
}
}
}
}
```

### ChatGPT

Basic Memory exposes OpenAI-compatible `search`

and `fetch`

tools for Custom

GPT actions. See the [ChatGPT integration
guide](https://docs.basicmemory.com/integrations/chatgpt/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme).

### Obsidian

No setup. Point Obsidian at `~/basic-memory`

(or your project folder) and the

same wikilinks, frontmatter, and Markdown your AI writes appear in your graph

view. Edit either side — sync handles the rest.

Try a prompt:

```
"Create a note about our project architecture decisions."
"Find information about JWT auth in my notes."
"What have I been working on this week?"
```


## What's New

**Automatic updates.**Basic Memory keeps itself up to date for`uv tool`


and Homebrew installs;`bm update`

triggers a manual check.**Semantic vector search.**Find notes by meaning, not just keywords.

Hybrid full-text + vector ranking with FastEmbed embeddings, on SQLite or

Postgres.**Optional search reranking.**Rescore the strongest vector and hybrid

candidates with a local FastEmbed cross-encoder or a LiteLLM-backed provider.**Schema system.**Infer, validate, and diff the structure of your

knowledge base with`schema_infer`

,`schema_validate`

,`schema_diff`

.**Per-project cloud routing.**Route individual projects through the cloud

while others stay local, via API key (`bm project set-cloud`

).**Smarter editing.**`edit_note`

append/prepend auto-creates notes when

missing;`write_note`

guards against accidental overwrites.**Richer search results.**Matched chunk text is included so the LLM gets

context, not just hits.**FastMCP 3.0 + tool annotations.**Every tool ships with MCP behavior

hints (`readOnlyHint`

,`destructiveHint`

,`idempotentHint`

,

`openWorldHint`

) so agents can discover capabilities progressively at

runtime instead of guessing or burning tokens.**CLI overhaul.**`--json`

output for scripting, workspace-aware commands,

and an htop-inspired project dashboard.

Full [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for v0.18 → v0.20.

## Optional cross-encoder reranking

Reranking adds a second relevance pass after vector or hybrid retrieval. It is

disabled by default because it adds inference latency and, for the local

provider, a first-run model download. Text, title, and permalink searches keep

their existing ranking.

Enable the default local FastEmbed reranker:

```
export BASIC_MEMORY_SEMANTIC_SEARCH_ENABLED=true
export BASIC_MEMORY_RERANKER_ENABLED=true
```

The default model is `jinaai/jina-reranker-v1-tiny-en`

. To use a hosted

reranker through LiteLLM instead:

```
export BASIC_MEMORY_SEMANTIC_SEARCH_ENABLED=true
export BASIC_MEMORY_RERANKER_ENABLED=true
export BASIC_MEMORY_RERANKER_PROVIDER=litellm
export BASIC_MEMORY_RERANKER_MODEL=cohere/rerank-v3.5
export COHERE_API_KEY=...
```

The feature fails fast on invalid configuration and does not silently fall

back to retrieval order when an enabled provider fails. See the

[semantic search guide](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/blob/main/docs/semantic-search.md#cross-encoder-reranking) for

provider setup, all settings, tuning, pagination, and failure behavior.

## Why Basic Memory

Most LLM conversations are ephemeral. You ask a question, get an answer, then

everything is forgotten. Workarounds have limits:

**Chat history**captures conversations but isn't structured knowledge.**RAG**lets the LLM query your documents but not write back to them.**Vector DBs**need complex infra and usually live in someone else's cloud.**Knowledge graphs**need specialized tooling to maintain.

Basic Memory takes a simpler path: **structured Markdown files that humans
and LLMs both read and write.**

- All knowledge stays in plain files you control.
- Both sides read and write to the same files.
- Familiar Markdown with semantic patterns — no new format to learn.
- A traversable graph the LLM can follow link by link.
- Works with the editors you already use (Obsidian, VS Code, anything).
- Just files plus a local SQLite index. No servers required.

## How it works

You're chatting normally about coffee:

I've been experimenting with brewing methods. Pour over gives more clarity


than French press, water at 205°F seems best, and freshly ground beans

make a huge difference.

Ask the LLM to capture it:

"Make a note on coffee brewing methods."


A Markdown file appears in your project directory in real time:

```
---
title: Coffee Brewing Methods
permalink: coffee-brewing-methods
tags: [coffee, brewing]
---
# Coffee Brewing Methods
## Observations
- [method] Pour over highlights subtle flavors over body
- [technique] Water at 205°F (96°C) extracts optimal compounds
- [principle] Freshly ground beans preserve aromatics
## Relations
- relates_to [[Coffee Bean Origins]]
- requires [[Proper Grinding Technique]]
- affects [[Flavor Extraction]]
```

Next session, the LLM picks up the thread. It follows the relations to

surface what you already know about Ethiopian beans and burr grinders, and

builds on it instead of starting over. You see the same files in Obsidian or

your editor. Edit them by hand — the AI sees your changes too.

Real two-way flow: humans edit Markdown, LLMs read/write through MCP, sync

keeps everything consistent, and the source of truth is always your files.

## The Markdown format

Each file is an `Entity`

. Entities have `Observations`

(facts about them) and

`Relations`

(links to other entities). That's the whole grammar.

### Frontmatter

```
---
title: <Entity title>
type: note
permalink: <uri-slug>
tags: [optional, list]
---
```

### Observations

Facts about the entity. Categories in `[brackets]`

, tags with `#`

, optional

context in parens.

```
- [method] Pour over highlights subtle flavors
- [tip] Grind medium-fine for V60 #brewing
- [fact] Lighter roasts contain more caffeine than dark
- [resource] James Hoffmann's V60 technique on YouTube
- [question] How does temperature affect compound extraction?
```

### Relations

Wiki-style links that form the graph. Single-token relation types, or quote

multi-word ones.

```
- pairs_well_with [[Chocolate Desserts]]
- grown_in [[Ethiopia]]
- requires [[Burr Grinder]]
- "pairs well with" [[Dark Chocolate]]
```

Bare `- [[Target]]`

and prose `- Worth checking out [[Target]]`

index as

`links_to`

. Full reference in the

[docs](https://docs.basicmemory.com/concepts/knowledge-format?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme).

## MCP tools

Basic Memory exposes these tools to any MCP client. Every tool is annotated

with MCP behavior hints (read-only, destructive, idempotent, open-world) so

agents can pick the right one without trial-and-error:

**Content:**`write_note`

,`read_note`

,`edit_note`

,`move_note`

,

`delete_note`

,`read_content`

,`view_note`

**Search & discovery:**`search_notes`

,`recent_activity`

,`list_directory`

**Knowledge graph:**`build_context`

(navigates`memory://`

URLs)**Projects:**`list_memory_projects`

,`list_workspaces`

,

`create_memory_project`

,`delete_project`

**Schema:**`schema_infer`

,`schema_validate`

,`schema_diff`

**Compatibility & diagnostics:**`search`

,`fetch`

,

`basic_memory_diagnostics`


All MCP tools default to text output; pass `output_format="json"`

for

structured responses. Full tool reference in the

[docs](https://docs.basicmemory.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme).

## CLI essentials

```
# Projects
basic-memory project list
basic-memory project add research ~/research
basic-memory project set-cloud research # route through cloud
basic-memory project set-local research # revert
# Config
basic-memory config list # all settings, effective values, env overrides
basic-memory config set cli_output_style plain # validated through the config model
basic-memory config unset cli_output_style # revert to default
# Health & maintenance
basic-memory status
basic-memory doctor # file <-> DB consistency check
basic-memory tool edit-note ... # CLI access to MCP tools
basic-memory update # check for and install updates
# Imports
basic-memory import claude conversations
basic-memory import chatgpt
basic-memory import memory-json
```

Routing flags (`--local`

/ `--cloud`

) force a target when you're in mixed

mode. Full CLI reference in the

[docs](https://docs.basicmemory.com/reference/cli-reference?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme).

## Auto-updates

CLI installs check for updates every 24 hours by default and apply them

silently (so the MCP server keeps responding).

- Supported install sources:
`uv tool`

, Homebrew - Skipped for
`uvx`

(ephemeral runtime managed by uv) - Manual:
`bm update`

(check + apply) or`bm update --check`

(check only)

Disable in `~/.basic-memory/config.json`

:

`{ "auto_update": false }`

## Telemetry

Minimal, anonymous events to understand the CLI-to-cloud conversion funnel.

**What we collect:** cloud promo impressions, cloud login attempts and

outcomes, promo opt-out events.

**What we don't:** file contents, note titles, knowledge base data, PII, IP

addresses, per-command or per-tool tracking.

Events go to our [Umami Cloud](https://umami.is) instance (open-source,

privacy-focused) on a background thread — never blocks the CLI.

Opt out:

`export BASIC_MEMORY_NO_PROMOS=1`

This disables promos and all telemetry.

## Logging

Basic Memory uses [Loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru). Defaults vary

by entry point:

| Entry point | Default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| CLI commands | File only | Doesn't interfere with command output |
| MCP server | File only | Stdout would corrupt JSON-RPC |
| API server | File (local) or stdout (cloud) | Docker/cloud uses stdout |

Log file: `~/.basic-memory/basic-memory.log`

(10MB rotation, 10 days

retention).

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
`BASIC_MEMORY_LOG_LEVEL` |
`INFO` |
DEBUG / INFO / WARNING / ERROR |
`BASIC_MEMORY_CLOUD_MODE` |
`false` |
API logs to stdout with structured context |
`BASIC_MEMORY_FORCE_LOCAL` |
`false` |
Force local API routing |
`BASIC_MEMORY_FORCE_CLOUD` |
`false` |
Force cloud API routing |
`BASIC_MEMORY_EXPLICIT_ROUTING` |
`false` |
Mark route selection as explicit |
`BASIC_MEMORY_ENV` |
`dev` |
Set to `test` for test mode (stderr only) |
`BASIC_MEMORY_NO_PROMOS` |
`false` |
Disable cloud promos and telemetry |
`BASIC_MEMORY_IMPORT_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` |
`104857600` |
Max uploaded import size |

```
BASIC_MEMORY_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG basic-memory reindex
tail -f ~/.basic-memory/basic-memory.log
```

## Development

Basic Memory supports SQLite (default, fast, no Docker) and Postgres

(via testcontainers — Docker required).

```
just install # Install with dev dependencies
just test-sqlite # All tests, SQLite
just test-postgres # All tests, Postgres (testcontainers)
just test # Both backends
just fast-check # fix/format/typecheck + impacted tests
just doctor # File <-> DB consistency check (temp config)
just package-check # Claude Code, skills, Hermes, OpenClaw package checks
just lint
just typecheck # Pyright (primary)
just typecheck-ty # ty (supplemental)
just format
just check # All quality checks
just migration "msg" # New Alembic migration
```

Tests use pytest markers: `windows`

, `benchmark`

, `smoke`

. See
