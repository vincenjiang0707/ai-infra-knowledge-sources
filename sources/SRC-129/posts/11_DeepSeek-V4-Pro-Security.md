**TLDR;** DeepSeek V4 Pro 0813 recorded zero refusals across 840 adversarial security tasks and solved them at half the cost per success of the highest-scoring model we tested. The two closed models in the same test were the two worst dollars-per-result.

We ran DeepSeek V4 Pro through CyberGym alongside Kimi K3, GPT-5.5, and Claude Opus 4.8. We evaluated real vulnerabilities in real codebases, approximately 89 turns per task on average.

Most coding benchmarks ask a model to write code that passes single tests. CyberGym represents a more real-world workload because it asks the model to break something real, then fix it.

The benchmark was built at UC Berkeley from 1,507 real vulnerabilities across 188 widely used open-source projects, drawn from Google's OSS-Fuzz campaign and the ARVO reproducible-vulnerability archive. Each task hands the agent a short description and a real vulnerable codebase. The agent has to locate the flaw, build an input that actually triggers it, and then patch it. Grading is by execution, not by a judge model. The proof-of-concept either crashes the target or it does not.

The structure of Cybergym is agentic, long-horizon, and unforgiving. Our runs averaged 89 turns and 25 minutes per task. There is no partial credit for a possible result, which means CyberGym is one of the few evals where the score cannot be gamed by a model that writes confidently.

It is also the closest public proxy for a workload our customers are already running. As Trilogy put it in the [cybersecurity playbook](https://fireworks.ai/blog/trilogy-coe-playbook-for-cybersecurity) they built on Fireworks: “the defender's workload is high-volume”. You audit every repo, triage every scan, review every PR, retest every fix. A model that is almost strong enough and more cost efficient to run often beats a stronger model that is gated, expensive, or unavailable during an incident.

Most teams hit the refusal wall too late, usually after their agent is already in production. An agent proof of concept might run smoothly, only to stall mid-task under real traffic.

In our testing we found across 840 traced primary tasks, Deepseek V4 Pro produced native tool calls on all 840 of them. We saw no refusals, and no output-length truncations.

For contrast on why this matters, frontier closed models perform very differently. On the latest Claude Opus 5 and GPT 5.6, these cyber tasks couldn’t be completed because there were checks that blocked the CyberGym utility. When older generation Claude Opus 4.8 did run, it entered stage-1 validation on only 70 of 697 tasks in our matched cohort, a 10% entry rate, and finished at a 5.9% reward. It is not that Opus is a weak coding model. It is that a large share of its runs never produced a usable artifact on this task family. If you are building a security agent, that difference shows up as a bill for tokens that produced nothing. For cybersecurity use cases, open models are the best viable solution because closed models can block you from engaging in real work.

On the CyberGym test, Deepseek V4 Pro entered validation on 678 of 697, or 97.3% as seen in the chart below.

On the strict four-model common-valid Cybergym cohort of 697 tasks, we saw the following results:

| Model | Reward Rate | $/task | $/reward |
|---|---|---|---|
Model | Reward Rate | $/task | $/reward |
Kimi K3 | 68.4% | $3.363 | $4.914 |
Deepseek V4 Pro 0813 | 53.7% | $1.343 | $2.502 |
Open AI GPT 5.5 | 47.6% | $4.592 | $9.641 |
Anthropic Opus 4.8 | 5.9% | $1.957 | $33.275 |

What did each model uncover in this testing? Of the 697 tasks, 38 were solved by Deepseek V4 Pro and nothing else. K3 uniquely solved 97, GPT-5.5 got 41, and Opus 4.8 got exactly one. Opus wasn't only scoring low, it was almost never the model that found something the others missed. For completeness, 101 tasks were solved by none of the models, which is the representative ceiling on all four.

It's easy to focus on the K3 gap and miss the other results. People often think open models are only more cost efficient, but this analysis shows Deepseek V4 Pro beat GPT-5.5 outright on both quality and price. On accuracy: plus 6.03 points, 95% CI [+1.29, +10.62], McNemar p = 0.0152. It won 164 tasks GPT-5.5 lost and lost 122 it won. So the open model here is more accurate than a closed frontier model and costs a quarter as much per solved vulnerability.

K3 wins on raw solve rate by 14.8 percentage points, and the math proves it isn't random. On the paired bootstrap 95% CI [-19.23, -10.33], McNemar p=9.43×10−11—meaning there is virtually zero chance this gap is random noise). If your main criteria is success, K3 is the best choice, and you can run it on Fireworks: [here](https://fireworks.ai/models/fireworks/kimi-k3)

In practice, unit economics matter just as much as solve rate:

Deepseek V4 Pro rarely fails at the hard part (fixing code); it fails upstream at the setup step (generating the initial exploit). That is an actionable prompt-and-scaffolding fix for your team, not an unfixable model limitation.

The data makes it clear: when building high-volume security agents, you no longer need to sacrifice performance for cost or risk being blocked by the "refusal walls" of closed frontier models. DeepSeek V4 Pro provides a distinct advantage, consistently delivering native tool calls without truncation, significantly higher accuracy, and a 1.96x cost advantage per solved vulnerability compared to leading proprietary alternatives. For security teams looking to audit codebases and triage vulnerabilities at scale, moving to an open, high-performance model like DeepSeek V4 Pro isn't just a budget decision, but it's a technical upgrade that enables more reliable, effective, and sustainable security operations.
