## Introduction[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#introduction)

### About Compute Sanitizer[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#about-compute-sanitizer)

Compute Sanitizer is a functional correctness checking suite included in the CUDA toolkit. This suite contains multiple tools that can perform different type of checks. The memcheck tool is capable of precisely detecting and attributing out of bounds and misaligned memory access errors in CUDA applications. The tool can also report hardware exceptions encountered by the GPU. The racecheck tool can report shared memory data access hazards that can cause data races. The initcheck tool can report cases where the GPU performs uninitialized accesses to global memory. The synccheck tool can report cases where the application is attempting invalid usages of synchronization primitives. This document describes the usage of these tools.

### Why Compute Sanitizer[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#why-compute-sanitizer)

NVIDIA allows developers to easily harness the power of GPUs to solve problems in parallel using CUDA. CUDA applications often run thousands of threads in parallel. Every programmer invariably encounters memory access errors and thread ordering, hazards that are hard to detect and time consuming to debug. The number of such errors increases substantially when dealing with thousands of threads. The Compute Sanitizer suite is designed to detect those problems in your CUDA application.

### How to Get Compute Sanitizer[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#how-to-get-compute-sanitizer)

Compute Sanitizer is installed as part of the CUDA toolkit.

### Compute Sanitizer Tools[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#compute-sanitizer-tools)

Compute Sanitizer provides different checking mechanisms through different tools. Currently the supported tools are:

### Compilation Options[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#compilation-options)

The Compute Sanitizer tools do not need any special compilation flags to function.

The output displayed by the Compute Sanitizer tools is more useful with some extra compiler flags. The `-G`

option to nvcc forces the compiler to generate debug information for the CUDA application. To generate line number information for applications without affecting the optimization level of the output, the `-lineinfo`

nvcc option can be used. The Compute Sanitizer tools fully support both of these options and can display source attribution of errors for applications compiled with line information.

For memcheck specifically, the `-fdevice-sanitize=memcheck`

option enables compile-time instrumentation, which provides significant performance improvements and enhanced error detection through base-and-bounds analysis. This flag instruments the code at compile time rather than at runtime. See [Compile-Time Patching](https://docs.nvidia.com/index.html#compile-time-patching) for more information.

Note

Option `-fdevice-sanitize=memcheck`

does not imply the generation of debug information. To get source attribution of errors, the application must also be compiled with `-lineinfo`

or `-G`

.

The stack backtrace feature of the Compute Sanitizer tools is more useful when the application contains function symbol names. For the host backtrace, this varies based on the host OS. On Linux, the host compiler must be given the `-rdynamic`

option to retain function symbols. On Windows, the application must be compiled for debugging, i.e. the `/Zi`

option. When using nvcc, flags to the host compiler can be specified using the `-Xcompiler`

option. For the device backtrace, the full frame information is only available when the application is compiled with device debug information. The compiler can skip generation of frame information when building with optimizations.

Sample command line to build with function symbols and device-side line information on Linux:

```
nvcc -Xcompiler -rdynamic -lineinfo -o out in.cu
```

Sample command line to build with compile-time memcheck instrumentation and device-side line information:

```
nvcc -fdevice-sanitize=memcheck -lineinfo -o out in.cu
```

## Memcheck Tool[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#memcheck-tool)

### What is Memcheck?[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#what-is-memcheck)

The memcheck tool is a run time error detection tool for CUDA applications. The tool can precisely detect and report out of bounds and misaligned memory accesses to global, local and shared memory in CUDA applications. It can also detect and report hardware reported error information. In addition, the memcheck tool can detect and report memory leaks in the user application.

### Supported Error Detection[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#supported-error-detection)

The errors that can be reported by the memcheck tool are summarized in the table below. The location column indicates whether the report originates from the host or from the device. The precision of an error is explained in the paragraph below.

Device |
Imprecise |

The memcheck tool reports two classes of errors precise and imprecise.

Precise errors in memcheck are those that the tool can uniquely identify and gather all information for. For these errors, memcheck can report the block and thread coordinates of the thread causing the failure, the program counter (PC) of the instruction performing the access, as well as the address being accessed and its size and type. If the CUDA application contains line number information (by either being compiled with device side debugging information, or with line information), then the tool will also print the source file and line number of the erroneous access.

Imprecise errors are errors reported by the hardware error reporting mechanism that could not be precisely attributed to a particular thread. The precision of the error varies based on the type of the error and in many cases, memcheck may not be able to attribute the cause of the error back to the source file and line.

### Using Memcheck[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-memcheck)

The memcheck tool is enabled by default when running the Compute Sanitizer application. It can also be explicitly enabled by using the `--tool memcheck`

option.

```
compute-sanitizer --tool memcheck [sanitizer_options] app_name [app_options]
```

When run in this way, the memcheck tool will look for precise, imprecise, malloc/free and CUDA API errors. The reporting of device leaks must be explicitly enabled. Errors identified by the memcheck tool are displayed on the screen after the application has completed execution. See [Understanding Memcheck Errors](https://docs.nvidia.com/index.html#understanding-memcheck-errors) for more information about how to interpret the messages printed by the tool.

### Understanding Memcheck Errors[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#understanding-memcheck-errors)

The memcheck tool can produce a variety of different errors. This is a short guide showing some samples of errors and explaining how the information in each error report can be interpreted.

Memory access error: Memory access errors are generated for errors that the memcheck tool can correctly attribute and identify the erroneous instruction. Below is an example of a precise memory access error.

========= Invalid __global__ write of size 4 bytes ========= at unaligned_kernel():0x160 in memcheck_demo.cu:6 ========= by thread (0,0,0) in block (0,0,0) ========= Address 0x7f6510c00001 is misaligned

Let us examine this error line by line:

Invalid __global__ write of size 4 bytes

The first line shows the memory segment, type and size being accessed. The memory segment is one of:

__global__ : for device global memory

__shared__ : for per block shared memory

__local__ : for per thread local memory


In this case, the access was to device global memory. The next field contains information about the type of access, whether it was a read or a write. In this case, the access is a write. Finally, the last item is the size of the access in bytes. In this example, the access was 4 bytes in size.

at unaligned_kernel():0x160 in memcheck_demo.cu:6

The second line contains the CUDA kernel name, offset of the instruction, the source file and line number (if available). In this example, the instruction causing the access was at offset 0x160 inside the

`unaligned_kernel`

CUDA kernel. Additionally, since the application was compiled with line number information, this instruction corresponds to line 6 in the memcheck_demo.cu source file.by thread (0,0,0) in block (0,0,0)

The third line contains the thread indices and block indices of the thread on which the error was hit. In this example, the thread doing the erroneous access belonged to the first thread in the first block.

Address 0x7f6510c00001 is misaligned

The fourth line contains the memory address being accessed and the type of access error. The type of access error can either be out of bounds access or misaligned access. In this example, the access was to address 0x7f6510c00001 and the access error was because this address was not aligned correctly.

Hardware exception: Imprecise errors are generated for errors that the hardware reports to the memcheck tool. Hardware exceptions have a variety of formats and messages. Typically, the first line will provide some information about the type of error encountered.

Malloc/free error: Malloc/free errors refer to the errors in the invocation of device side

`malloc()/free()`

in CUDA kernels. An example of a malloc/free error:========= Malloc/Free error encountered : Double free ========= at 0x79d8 ========= by thread (0,0,0) in block (0,0,0) ========= Address 0x400aff920

We can examine this line by line.

Malloc/Free error encountered : Double free

The first line indicates that this is a malloc/free error, and contains the type of error. This type can be:

Double free – This indicates that the thread called

`free()`

on an allocation that has already been freed.Invalid pointer to free – This indicates that

`free`

was called on a pointer that was not returned by`malloc()`

.Heap corruption : This indicates generalized heap corruption, or cases where the state of the heap was modified in a way that memcheck did not expect.


In this example, the error is due to calling

`free()`

on a pointer which had already been freed.at 0x79d8

The second line gives the PC on GPU where the error was reported. This PC is usually inside of system code, and is not interesting to the user. The device frame backtrace will contain the location in user code where the

`malloc()/free()`

call was made.by thread (0,0,0) in block (0,0,0)

The third line contains the thread and block indices of the thread that caused this error. In this example, the thread has threadIdx = (0,0,0) and blockIdx = (0,0,0)

Address 0x400aff920

This line contains the value of the pointer passed to

`free()`

or returned by`malloc()`

Leak errors: Errors are reported for allocations created using cudaMalloc and for allocations on the device heap that were not freed before their associated CUDA context was destroyed (i.e. program exit,

`cudaDeviceReset()`

or CUDA driver API call to`cuCtxDestroy()`

). An example of a cudaMalloc allocation leak report is the following:========= Leaked 64 bytes at 0x400200200

The error message reports information about the size of the allocation that was leaked as well as the address of the allocation on the device.

A device heap leak message will be explicitly identified as such:

========= Leaked 16 bytes at 0x4012ffff6 on the device heap

CUDA API error: CUDA API errors are reported for CUDA API calls that return an error value. An example of a CUDA API error:


========= Program hit invalid copy direction for memcpy (error 21) on CUDA API call to cudaMemcpy.The message contains the returned value of the CUDA API call, as well as the name of the API function that was called.


### CUDA API Error Checking[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-api-error-checking)

The memcheck tool supports reporting an error if a CUDA API call made by the user program returned an error. The tool supports this detection for both CUDA run time and CUDA driver API calls. In all cases, if the API function call has a nonzero return value, Compute Sanitizer will print an error message containing the name of the API call that failed and the return value of the API call.

CUDA API error reports do not terminate the application, they merely provide extra information. It is up to the application to check the return status of CUDA API calls and handle error conditions appropriately.

#### Reporting Modes[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#reporting-modes)

The `--report-api-errors`

option controls the level of API error reporting:

**all**: Report all CUDA API errors, including APIs invoked implicitly by the CUDA runtime, extended API errors captured from internal CUDA logging, and explicit user-called APIs.**extended**(default): Report errors from explicit CUDA API calls made by user code, plus extended API errors captured from internal CUDA error logging (similar to behavior of`CUDA_LOG_FILE`

).**explicit**: Report errors only from explicit CUDA API calls made directly by user code.**no**: Disable CUDA API error reporting.

Extended mode captures errors that are logged internally by the CUDA driver but may not always be surfaced through normal API return codes. This provides more comprehensive error detection similar to what would be captured in `CUDA_LOG_FILE`

.

#### Excluded Errors[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#excluded-errors)

The following API errors are not reported as they are commonly used for polling or state checking:

`cudaErrorNotReady`

for`cudaEventQuery`

and`cudaStreamQuery`

APIs.`cudaErrorPeerAccessAlreadyEnabled`

for`cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess`

API.`cudaErrorPeerAccessNotEnabled`

for`cudaDeviceDisablePeerAccess`

API.

### Device Side Allocation Checking[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#device-side-allocation-checking)

The memcheck tool checks accesses to allocations in the device heap.

These allocations are created by calling `malloc()`

inside a kernel. This feature is implicitly enabled and can be disabled by specifying the `--check-device-heap no`

option. This feature is only activated for kernels in the application that call `malloc()`

.

The tool will report an error if the application calls a `free()`

twice for the same allocation, or if it calls `free()`

on an invalid pointer.

By default, the tool will report a warning if a call to `malloc()`

fails. This feature can be disabled using the `--report-device-side-allocation-failure no`

option.

Note

Note: Make sure to look at the device side backtrace to find the location in the application where the `malloc()/free()`

call was made.

### Leak Checking[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#leak-checking)

The memcheck tool can detect leaks of allocated memory.

Memory leaks are device side allocations that have not been freed by the time the context is destroyed. The memcheck tool tracks device memory allocations created using the CUDA driver or runtime APIs.

The `--leak-check full`

option must be specified to enable leak checking.

### Padding[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#padding)

The memcheck tool can automatically add padding to memory allocations in order to improve out of bounds error detection for global memory.

By default, global memory buffers can be allocated back-to-back in the virtual address space. When that happens, an overflow access into the first buffer will simply happen in the second buffer and not be detected as out-of-bounds.

Using the `--padding`

option will automatically extend the allocation size, effectively creating a padding buffer after each allocation. This improves the out of bounds error detection as accesses to the padding area will always be considered invalid. The example below displays possible buffer addresses when using `--padding 32`

. Every allocation is followed by a 32 bytes padding buffer. Writing or reading this buffer will cause an out-of-bounds access to be reported.

This option supports allocations created via the `cudaMalloc`

APIs, `cudaHostAlloc`

and `cudaMallocHost`

.

This option does not support allocations created via `cudaHostRegister`

or the CUDA virtual memory management APIs.

Be aware that using this option will result in an increased device memory pressure, potentially causing additional CUDA out of memory errors.

### Stream-ordered race detection[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#stream-ordered-race-detection)

The memcheck tool can detect stream-ordered allocations races using the `--track-stream-ordered-races all`

option. It will report accesses to stream-ordered allocations used outside of their lifespan.

The tool is capable of detecting 2 types of races:

Use-before-alloc races (

`--track-stream-ordered-races use-before-alloc`

)This race occurs when an allocation is used before it is available: an allocation created using

`cudaMallocAsync`

on a stream cannot be used on another stream without a prior synchronization event after the allocation.It also includes cases where an allocation is freed before it is available using

`cudaFreeAsync`

.Use-after-free races (

`--track-stream-ordered-races use-after-free`

)This race occurs when an allocation is used after it is freed: an allocation freed using

`cudaFreeAsync`

on a stream cannot be used on another stream without a following synchronization event before the free.

### Tensor Core MMA guardrails[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#tensor-core-mma-guardrails)

On Blackwell GPUs, if a program is using the [PTX Tensor Core 5th generation family instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#tensorcore-5th-generation-instructions)
(`tcgen05.*`

), the PTX optimizing assembler can be instructed to insert
guardrails around TCMMA instructions using PTXAS flag `-g-tmem-access-check`

.

Running a program with TCMMA guardrails enabled under compute-sanitizer’s memcheck will lead the tool to report any invalid TCMMA operation, such as an out-of-bounds or misaligned access to tensor memory, or allocation after call to relinquish.

Example of TCMMA error reported by memcheck:

```
========= Tensor Memory column 32 being accessed by instruction tcgen05.ld is not allocated. Columns allocated are: 0-31.
========= at $__internal_8_$__cuda_sm10x_tcgen05_guardrail_trap_unallocated_columns_access+0x1250 in TcmmaGuardrails.cu:99
========= by thread (0,0,0) in block (0,0,0)
```

## Racecheck Tool[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#racecheck-tool)

### What is Racecheck?[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#what-is-racecheck)

The racecheck tool is a run time shared memory data access hazard detector. The primary use of this tool is to help identify memory access race conditions in CUDA applications that use shared memory.

In CUDA applications, storage declared with the `__shared__`

qualifier is placed on chip shared memory. All threads in a thread block can access this per block shared memory. Shared memory goes out of scope when the thread block completes execution. As shared memory is on chip, it is frequently used for inter-thread communication and as a temporary buffer to hold data being processed. As this data is being accessed by multiple threads in parallel, incorrect program assumptions may result in data races. Racecheck is a tool built to identify these hazards and help users write programs free of shared memory races.

Currently, this tool only supports detecting accesses to on-chip shared memory.

### What are Hazards?[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#what-are-hazards)

A data access hazard is a case where two threads attempt to access the same location in memory resulting in non-deterministic behavior, based on the relative order of the two accesses. These hazards cause data races where the behavior or the output of the application depends on the order in which all parallel threads are executed by the hardware. Race conditions manifest as intermittent application failures or as failures when attempting to run a working application on a different GPU.

The racecheck tool identifies three types of canonical hazards in a program. These are :

Write-After-Write (WAW) hazards

This hazard occurs when two threads attempt to write data to the same memory location. The resulting value in that location depends on the relative order of the two accesses.

Write-After-Read (WAR) hazards

This hazard occurs when two threads access the same memory location, with one thread performing a read and another a write. In this case, the writing thread is ordered before the reading thread and the value returned to the reading thread is not the original value at the memory location.

Read-After-Write (RAW) hazards

This hazard occurs when two threads access the same memory location, with one thread performing a read and the other a write. In this case, the reading thread reads the value before the writing thread commits it.


### Using Racecheck[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-racecheck)

The racecheck tool is enabled by running the Compute Sanitizer application with the `--tool racecheck`

option.

```
compute-sanitizer --tool racecheck [sanitizer_options] app_name [app_options]
```

Once racecheck has identified a hazard, the user can make program modifications to ensure this hazard is no longer present. In the case of Write-After-Write hazards, the program should be modified so that multiple writes are not happening to the same location. In the case of Read-After-Write and Write-After-Read hazards, the reading and writing locations should be deterministically ordered. In CUDA kernels, this can be achieved by inserting a `__syncthreads()`

call between the two accesses. To avoid races between threads within a single warp, `__syncwarp()`

can be used.

Note

Note: The racecheck tool does not perform any memory access error checking. It is recommended that users first run the memcheck tool to ensure the application is free of errors.

### Racecheck Report Modes[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#racecheck-report-modes)

The racecheck tool can produce two types of output:

Hazard reports

These reports contain detailed information about one particular hazard. Each hazard report is byte accurate and represents information about conflicting accesses between two threads that affect this byte of shared memory.

Analysis reports

These reports contain a post analysis set of reports. These reports are produced by the racecheck tool by analysing multiple hazard reports and examining active device state. For example usage of analysis reports, see

[Understanding Racecheck Analysis Reports](https://docs.nvidia.com/index.html#understanding-racecheck-analysis-reports).

### Understanding Racecheck Analysis Reports[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#understanding-racecheck-analysis-reports)

In analysis reports, the racecheck tool produces a series of high-level messages that identify the source locations of a particular race, based on observed hazards and other machine state.

A sample racecheck analysis report is below:

```
========= WARNING: Race reported between Write access at RAW()+0xf0 in raceGroupBasic.cu:40
========= and Read access at RAW()+0x280 in raceGroupBasic:46 [4 hazards]
```

The analysis record contains high-level information about the hazard that is conveyed to the end user. Each line contains information about a unique location in the application which is participating in the race.

The first word on the first line indicates the severity of this report. In this case, the message is at the WARNING level of severity. For more information on the different severity levels, see [Racecheck Severity Levels](https://docs.nvidia.com/index.html#racecheck-severity-levels). Analysis reports are composed of one or more racecheck hazards, and the severity level of the report is that of the hazard with the highest severity.

The first line additionally contains the type of access. The access can be either:

Read

Write


The next item on the line is the name of the kernel issuing the access and the offset of the location where the access happened from. In this case, the offset is 0xf0 in the RAW() kernel. If the application was compiled with line number information, this line also contains the file name and line number of the access.

The next lines contain the location of the other offsets participating in the race condition. In this case, there is only one other location which is the RAW() kernel at offset 0x280. Similarly to the first line, file name and line number are printed if the application was compiled with line number information. Finally, the line also contains the number of hazards detected for this specific race condition.

A given analysis report will always contain at least one line which is performing a write access. A common strategy to eliminate races which contain only write accesses is to ensure that the write access is performed by only one thread. In the case of races with multiple readers and one writer, introducing explicit program ordering via a `__syncthreads()`

call can avoid the race condition. For races between threads within the same warp, the `__syncwarp()`

intrinsic can be used to avoid the hazard.

### Understanding Racecheck Hazard Reports[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#understanding-racecheck-hazard-reports)

In hazard reporting mode, the racecheck tool produces a series of messages detailing information about hazards in the application. The tool is byte accurate and produces a message for each byte on which a hazard was detected. Additionally, when enabled, the host backtrace for the launch of the kernel will also be displayed.

A sample racecheck hazard is below:

```
========= ERROR: Potential WAW hazard detected at __shared__ 0x0 in block (0,0,0) :
========= Write Thread (0,0,0) at WAW()+0x2f0 in raceWAW.cu:20
========= Write Thread (1,0,0) at WAW()+0x2f0 in raceWAW.cu:20
========= Current Value : 1, Incoming Value : 2
```

The hazard records are dense and capture a lot of interesting information. In general terms, the first line contains information about the hazard severity, type and address, as well as information about the thread block where it occurred. The next 2 lines contain detailed information about the two threads that were in contention. These two lines are ordered chronologically, so the first entry is for the access that occurred earlier and the second for the access that occurred later. The final line is printed for some hazard types and captures the actual data that was being written.

Examining this line by line, we have :

```
ERROR: Potential WAW hazard detected at __shared__ 0x0 in block (0, 0, 0)
```

The first word on this line indicates the severity of this hazard. In this case, the message is at the ERROR level of severity. For more information on the different severity levels, see [Racecheck Severity Levels](https://docs.nvidia.com/index.html#racecheck-severity-levels).

The next piece of information here is the type of hazard. The racecheck tool detects three types of hazards:

WAW or Write-After-Write hazards

WAR or Write-After-Read hazards

RAW or Read-After-Write hazards


The type of hazard indicates the accesses types of the two threads that were in contention. In this example, the hazard is of Write-After-Write type.

The next piece of information is the address in shared memory that was being accessed. This is the offset in per block shared memory that was being accessed by both threads. Since the racecheck tool is byte accurate, the message is only for the byte of memory at given address. In this example, the byte being accessed is byte 0x0 in shared memory.

Finally, the first line contains the block index of the thread block to which the two racing threads belong.

The second line contains information about the first thread to write to this location.

```
Write Thread (0, 0, 0) at WAW()+0x2f0 in raceWAW.cu:20(void)
```

The first item on this line indicates the type of access being performed by this thread to the shared memory address. In this example, the thread was writing to the location. The next component is the index of the thread block. In this case, the thread is at index (0,0,0). Following this, we have the name of the kernel and byte offset of the instruction which did the access in the kernel. In this example, the offset is 0x2f0. This is followed by the source file and line number (if line number information is available).

The third line contains similar information about the second thread that was causing this hazard. This line has an identical format to the previous line.

The fourth line contains information about the data in the two accesses.

```
Current Value : 1, Incoming Value : 2
```

If the second thread in the hazard was performing a write access, i.e., the hazard is a Write-After-Write (WAW) or a Write-After-Read (WAR), this line contains the value after the access by the first thread as the Current Value and the value that will be written by the second access as the Incoming Value. In this case, the first thread wrote the value 1 to the shared memory location. The second thread is attempting to write the value 2.

### Racecheck Severity Levels[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#racecheck-severity-levels)

Problems reported by racecheck can be of different severity levels. Depending on the level, different actions are required from developers. By default, only issues of severity level WARNING and ERROR are shown. The command line option `--print-level`

can be used to set the lowest severity level that should be reported.

Racecheck reports have one of the following severity levels:

INFO: The lowest level of severity. This is for hazards that have no impact on program execution and hence are not contributing to data access hazards. It is still a good idea to find and eliminate such hazards.

WARNING: Hazards at this level of severity are determined to be programming model hazards, however may be intentionally created by the programmer. An example of this are hazards due to warp level programming that make the assumption that threads are proceeding in groups. Such hazards are typically only encountered by advanced programmers. In cases where a beginner programmer encounters such errors, he should treat them as sources of hazards.

*ERROR*: The highest level of severity. This corresponds to hazards that are very likely candidates for causing data access races. Programmers would be well advised to examine errors at this level of severity.

Note

On modern GPU architectures, programmers cannot rely on the assumption that threads within a warp execute in lock-step unconditionally. This assumption used to be true on legacy GPU code (pre-Volta architectures, like Kepler, Maxwell and Pascal). As a result, warnings due to warp-synchronous programming without explicit synchronization must be fixed when developing or porting applications from pre-Volta architectures to newer ones. Developers can use the `__syncwarp()`

intrinsic or the Cooperative Groups API.

### Racecheck support for `cuda::barrier`

[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#racecheck-support-for-cuda-barrier)

Racecheck supports synchronization through `cuda::barrier`

on Ampere GPUs and newer.

The number of barriers tracked by the tool is based on the number of barriers present in the source code as reported by compiler information. In some cases, the compiler may undercount this number. Racecheck will report the following warning if more barriers are used than expected:

```
========= Warning: Detected overflow of tracked cuda::barrier structures. Results might be incorrect. Try using --num-cuda-barriers to fix the issue
```

The `--num-cuda-barriers`

option can be used to indicate the number of expected barriers in the source code and workaround this issue.

### Racecheck support for asynchronous copy[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#racecheck-support-for-asynchronous-copy)

Racecheck supports race detection on shared memory for asynchronous memory copy operations from global to shared memory introduced in compute capability 8.0. These can take the form of CUDA C++ `cuda::memcpy_async`

or the PTX `cp.async`

. Specifically, racecheck is able to detect when the target of a asynchronous copy tracked by a pipeline (CUDA C++) or async-group (PTX) was accessed before the required commit/wait to guarantee its completion. In these cases, individual hazards when using `--racecheck-report hazard`

will bear the mention `(invalid memcpy_async synchronization)`

. These checks can be disabled by using `--racecheck-memcpy-async no`

.

### Racecheck cluster entry and exit race detection[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#racecheck-cluster-entry-and-exit-race-detection)

Racecheck supports race detection on remote shared memory accesses without appropriate cluster-wide synchronization. When a kernel makes a remote shared memory access from one block to another (in the same cluster), it needs to guarantee that the target block exists, otherwise error `cudaErrorLaunchFailure`

is raised. One way to achieve this is using cluster.sync() from the [Cluster Group API](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#cluster-group) . Refer to the [CUDA documentation about distributed shared memory](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#distributed-shared-memory) for more information.

When running a program under Racecheck, instead of failing, the tool will report these two types of illegal accesses:

Late entry race detection: a block is trying to access shared memory from another block in the cluster without an appropriate cluster-wide synchronization beforehand.

Early exit race detection: a block is trying to access shared memory from another block in the cluster without an appropriate cluster-wide synchronization before the target block exits.


A sample report for both races is below:

```
========= Potential invalid __shared__ read of size 4 bytes
========= at RemoteAccess(int *, int)+0x170 in RaceCluster.cu:10
========= by thread (0,0,0) in block (0,0,0)
========= Address 0x1000400 is located in a block that might not have entered yet
=========
========= Potential invalid __shared__ read of size 4 bytes
========= at RemoteAccess(int *, int)+0x170 in RaceCluster.cu:10
========= by thread (0,0,0) in block (0,0,0)
========= Address 0x1000400 is located in a block that might have already exited
=========
```

### Racecheck synchronization tracing[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#racecheck-synchronization-tracing)

Racecheck supports logging of synchronization operations primarily to aid in debugging synchronization issues. To enable this feature, use the `--racecheck-trace-sync yes`

option together with the Racecheck tool.

Note

Note: Turning on the `--racecheck-trace-sync`

option automatically sets the reported severity level to INFO. See [Racecheck Severity Levels](https://docs.nvidia.com/index.html#racecheck-severity-levels).

Currently, the logging of the following synchronization operations is supported:



`syncwarp`


`barrier`


`cuda::barrier`


`cluster barrier`


`asynchronous bulk copy`


A general form of a log entry is as follows:

```
========= Barrier called by threads starting at (32,0,0) in block (1,0,0), (active mask: 0xffffffff) at kernel()+0x2b0 in app.cu:36
```

It consists of the type of instruction, a set of threads executing the instruction (this is the combination of the starting thread index, block index, and active thread mask), and the call site. Different instruction types may have different sets of extra information. For example, for `cuda::barrier`

, the barrier address is also printed.

In the case of `syncwarp`

, the format differs significantly:

```
========= Syncwarp called by threads starting at (0,0,0) in block (0,0,0), (active mask: 0xffff0000) at kernel()+0x3c0 in app.cu:42
========= Sync mask of thread 16: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 17: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 18: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 19: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 20: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 21: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 22: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 23: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 24: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 25: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 26: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 27: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 28: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 29: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 30: 0xffff0000
========= Sync mask of thread 31: 0xffff0000
```

Here, besides the usual information, the mask of each thread is printed. This type of information is useful for debugging `syncwarp`

hangs caused by an incorrect mask or missing thread.

### Racecheck Deadlock Detection[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#racecheck-deadlock-detection)

Racecheck supports the detection of some types of deadlocks. To enable this feature, use the `--racecheck-deadlock-timeout n`

option together with the Racecheck tool.
Here, `n`

is the number of milliseconds after which the deadlock detection is triggered. The default value is 0, which means that deadlock detection is disabled.
Very small values of `n`

may lead to false positives. If you experience false positives, try increasing the value of `n`

.

Currently, deadlock detection is supported for:



`cuda::barriers`


When a deadlock is detected, the tool prints a message similar to the following:

```
========= Deadlock detected in Cuda::barrier wait called by threads starting at (0,0,0) in block (0,0,0), (active mask: 0xffffffff), barrier address: 0x0 at kernel+0x1190 in app.cu:98
```

There is also an option to terminate an application upon deadlock. To enable this feature, use the `--racecheck-continue-on-deadlock no`

option together with enabled deadlock detection and the Racecheck tool.

## Initcheck Tool[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#initcheck-tool)

### What is Initcheck?[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#what-is-initcheck)

The initcheck tool is a run time uninitialized device memory access detector. This tool can identify when device memory is accessed without it being initialized via device side writes, or via CUDA memcpy and memset API calls.

### Using Initcheck[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-initcheck)

The initcheck tool is enabled by running the Compute Sanitizer application with the `--tool initcheck`

option.

```
compute-sanitizer --tool initcheck [sanitizer_options] app_name [app_options]
```

Note

The initcheck tool does not perform any memory access error checking. It is recommended that users first run the memcheck tool to ensure the application is free of errors.

### Initcheck Address Space Selection[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#initcheck-address-space-selection)

By default, initcheck will only check for uninitialized memory accesses in the device global memory. Using the `--initcheck-address-space`

option with the `shared`

value will change the checked address space to device shared memory instead.

```
compute-sanitizer --tool initcheck --initcheck-address-space shared app_name [app_options]
```

Below is an example of a report containing an uninitialized memory access error in the device shared memory:

```
========= Uninitialized __shared__ memory read of size 4 bytes
========= at KernelSharedError()+0x1a0 in uninitialized_shared.cu:7
========= by thread (0,0,0) in block (0,0,0)
========= Address 0x0
```

Checking both address spaces can be done using the `all`

value.

```
compute-sanitizer --tool initcheck --initcheck-address-space all app_name [app_options]
```

### Unused memory detection[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#unused-memory-detection)

The initcheck tool can also be used to detect unused memory by using the `--track-unused-memory`

option.

```
compute-sanitizer --tool initcheck --track-unused-memory app_name [app_options]
```

Two samples of unused memory report are below:

```
========= Unused __shared__ memory in allocation of size 100 bytes in block (0,0,0)
========= Not written 80 bytes at offset 0x14 (0x14)
========= These unused bytes represent 80% of the shared memory.
=========
========= Unused __global__ memory in allocation 0x7fed9f400000 of size 100 bytes
========= Not written 80 bytes at offset 0x14 (0x7fed9f400014)
========= 80% of allocation were unused.
```

These reports contain the address and size of the allocation, the number of bytes not used and their location. The location can be a range if all unused bytes are not contiguous.

The behavior for this feature can be adjusted with two options.

The first one is `--unused-memory-threshold`

which takes the minimum percentage at which reports should be printed. For instance, using a value of 81 or above would silence the sample reports above.

The second one is `--unused-shared-memory-report-limit`

which takes the maximum number of unused shared memory reports to be printed per launch. The default value is 32.

Note

Note: Beware of padding. The size of the allocation may be larger than the one specified in the kernel, leading to reports of unused memory that might not be acted upon.

## Synccheck Tool[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#synccheck-tool)

### What is Synccheck?[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#what-is-synccheck)

The synccheck tool is a runtime tool that can identify whether a CUDA application is correctly using synchronization primitives, specifically `__syncthreads()`

and `__syncwarp()`

intrinsics and their Cooperative Groups API counterparts.

### Using Synccheck[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-synccheck)

The synccheck tool is enabled by running the Compute Sanitizer application with the `--tool synccheck`

option.

```
compute-sanitizer --tool synccheck [sanitizer_options] app_name [app_options]
```

Note

The synccheck tool does not perform any memory access error checking. It is recommended that users first run the memcheck tool to ensure the application is free of errors.

### Understanding Synccheck Reports[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#understanding-synccheck-reports)

For each violation, the synccheck tool produces a report message that identifies the source location of the violation and its classification.

A sample synccheck report is below:

```
========= Barrier error detected. Divergent thread(s) in warp
========= at ThreadDivergence(int *, int)+0xf0 in divergence.cu:79
========= by thread (37,0,0) in block (0,0,0)
```

Each report starts with “Barrier error detected.” In most cases, this is followed by a classification of the detected barrier error. In this message, a CUDA block with divergent threads was found. The following error classes can be reported:

Divergent thread(s) in block: Divergence between threads within a block was detected for a barrier that does not support this on the current architecture. For example, this occurs when

`__syncthreads()`

is used within conditional code but the conditional does not evaluate equally across all threads in the block.Divergent thread(s) in warp: Divergence between threads within a single warp was detected for a barrier that does not support this on the current architecture.

Invalid arguments: A barrier instruction or primitive was used with invalid arguments. This can occur for example if not all threads reaching a

`__syncwarp()`

declare themselves in the mask parameter. However, synccheck will not detect cases where not all the threads declared in the mask parameter reach the`__syncwarp()`

.

The next line states the offset within the function of the location where the access happened. In this case, the offset is 0xf0. If the application was compiled with line number information, this line would also contain the file name and line number of the access, followed by the name of the kernel issuing the access.

The third line contains information on the thread and block for which this violation was detected. In this case, it is thread 37 in block 0.

### Synccheck support for `cuda::barrier`

[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#synccheck-support-for-cuda-barrier)

Synccheck supports synchronization through `cuda::barrier`

on Ampere GPUs and newer.

The number of barriers tracked by the tool is based on the number of barriers present in the source code as reported by compiler information. In some cases, the compiler may undercount this number. Synccheck will report the following warning if more barriers are used than expected:

```
========= Warning: Detected overflow of tracked cuda::barrier structures. Results might be incorrect. Try using --num-cuda-barriers to fix the issue
```

The `--num-cuda-barriers`

option can be used to indicate the number of expected barriers in the source code and workaround this issue.

### Synccheck support for `wgmma`

[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#synccheck-support-for-wgmma)

Synccheck supports additional checks related to PTX `wgmma`

instructions for Hopper sm_90a architecture.

[wgmma](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-instructions) instructions are executed across a [warpgroup](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-instructions-warpgroup). Each warp in the warpgroup are expected to execute the same `wgmma`

instructions in the same order with the same predicates, with all threads active or none. Synccheck can detect and report cases where these rules are not respected, and will exit the entire warpgroup when detected. In such cases, the report will start with “Warpgroup MMA sequence error detected” instead of “Barrier error detected”, followed by a description of the specific error encountered. The error is reported once per warp encountering the error.

The `--check-warpgroup-mma`

option can be used to enable or disable these checks.

## Compute Sanitizer Features[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#compute-sanitizer-features)

### Nonblocking Mode[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#nonblocking-mode)

By default, the standalone Compute Sanitizer tool will launch kernels in nonblocking mode. This allows the tool to support error reporting in applications running concurrent kernels

To force kernels to execute serially, a user can use the `--force-blocking-launches`

option. One side effect is that when in blocking mode, only the first thread to hit an error in a kernel will be reported. Also, using this option or `--force-synchronization-limit`

will disable CUDA reduced API serialization.

### Stack Backtraces[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#stack-backtraces)

Compute Sanitizer can generate backtraces when given `--show-backtrace`

option. Backtraces usually consist of two sections – a saved host backtrace that leads up to the CUDA driver call site, and a device backtrace at the time of the error. Each backtrace contains a list of frames showing the state of the stack at the time the backtrace was created.

To get function names in the host backtraces, the user application must be built with support for symbol information in the host application. For more information, see [Compilation Options](https://docs.nvidia.com/index.html#compilation-options)

Backtraces are printed for most Compute Sanitizer tool outputs, and the information generated varies depending on the type of output. The table below explains the kind of host and device backtrace seen under different conditions.

Output Type |
Host Backtrace |
Device Backtrace |
|---|---|---|
Memory access error |
Kernel launch on host |
Precise backtrace on device |
Hardware exception |
Kernel launch on host |
Imprecise backtrace on device |
Malloc/Free error |
Kernel launch on host |
Precise backtrace on device |
cudaMalloc allocation leak |
Callsite of cudaMalloc |
N/A |
CUDA API error |
Callsite of CUDA API call |
N/A |

### Name Demangling[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#name-demangling)

The Compute Sanitizer suite supports displaying mangled and demangled names for CUDA kernels and CUDA device functions. By default, tools display the fully demangled name, which contains the name of the kernel as well as its prototype information. In the simple demangle mode, the tools will only display the first part of the name. If demangling is disabled, tools will display the complete mangled name of the kernel.

### Dynamic Parallelism[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#dynamic-parallelism)

The Compute Sanitizer tool suite supports dynamic parallelism. The memcheck tool supports precise error reporting of out of bounds and misaligned accesses on global, local and shared memory accesses, as well as on global atomic instructions for applications using dynamic parallelism. In addition, the imprecise hardware exception reporting mechanism is also fully supported. Error detection on applications using dynamic parallelism requires significantly more memory on the device; as a result, in memory constrained environments, memcheck may fail to initialize with an internal out of memory error.

For limitations, see the known limitations in the Release Notes section.

### Error Actions[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#error-actions)

When encountering an error, Compute Sanitizer behavior depends on the type of error. The default behavior of Compute Sanitizer is to continue execution on purely host side errors. Hardware exceptions detected by the memcheck tool cause the CUDA context to be destroyed. Precise errors (such as memory access and malloc/free errors) detected by the memcheck tool cause the kernel to be terminated. This terminates the kernel without running any subsequent instructions and the application continues launching other kernels in the CUDA context. The handling of memory access and malloc/free errors detected by the memcheck tool can be changed using the `--destroy-on-device-error`

option.

For racecheck detected hazards, the hazard is reported, but execution is not affected.

For a full summary of error action, based on the type of the error see the table below. The error action terminate kernel refers to the cases where the kernel is terminated early, and no subsequent instructions are run. In such cases, the CUDA context is not destroyed and other kernels continue execution and CUDA API calls can still be made.

Note

When kernel execution is terminated early, the application may not have completed its computations on data. Any subsequent kernels that depend on this data will have undefined behavior.

The action terminate CUDA context refers to the cases where the CUDA context is forcibly terminated. In such cases, all outstanding work for the context is terminated and subsequent CUDA API calls will fail. The action continue application refers to cases where the application execution is not impacted, and the kernel continues executing instructions.

### Escape Sequences[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#escape-sequences)

The `--save`

and `--log-file`

options to Compute Sanitizer accept the following escape sequences in the file name.

`%%`

: Replaced with a literal %.`%p`

: Replaced with the PID of the Compute Sanitizer frontend application.`%q{ENVVAR}`

: Replaced with the contents of the environment variable`ENVVAR`

. If the variable does not exist, this is replaced with an empty string.Any other character following the % causes an error.


### Specifying Filters[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#specifying-filters)

Compute Sanitizer tools support filtering the choice of kernels which should be checked. When a filter is specified, only kernels matching the filter will be checked. Filters are specified using the `--kernel-name`

and `--kernel-name-exclude`

options. By default, the Compute Sanitizer tools will check all kernels in the application.

The `--kernel-name`

and `--kernel-name-exclude`

options can be specified multiple times. If a kernel satisfies any filter, it will be checked by the running the Compute Sanitizer tool.

The `--kernel-name`

and `--kernel-name-exclude`

options take a filter specification consisting of a list of comma separated key value pairs, specified as `key=value`

. When using the regex filter key, multiple key value pairs need to be specified through multiple use of the option instead. In order for a filter to be matched, all components of the filter specification must be satisfied. If a filter is incorrectly specified in any component, the entire filter is ignored. For a full summary of valid key values, see the table below. If a key has multiple strings, any of the strings can be used to specify that filter component.

Name |
Key String |
Value |
Comments |
|---|---|---|---|
Kernel Name |
kernel_name, kne |
Complete mangled kernel name |
User specifies the complete mangled kernel name. |
Kernel Substring |
kernel_substring, kns |
Any substring in mangled kernel name |
User specifies a substring in the mangled kernel name. |
Regex |
regex |
Any regex that can be matched in a substring of the mangled kernel name |
User specifies a regular expression searched in the mangled kernel name. |

When using the `kernel-name`

filters, the Compute Sanitizer tools will check all `device`

function calls made by the kernel. When using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism (CDP), the Compute Sanitizer tools will not check child kernels launched from a checked kernel unless the child kernel matches a filter. If a GPU launched kernel that does not match a filter calls a device function that is reachable from a kernel that does match a filter, the device function behaves as though it was checked. In the case of some tools, this can result in undefined behavior.

**Filter usage example**

We consider an application that launches three different kernels declared below.

```
__global__ void gamma(int *bufer);
__global__ void delta(int *bufer);
__global__ void epsilon(int *bufer);
```

Their respective mangled names are `_Z5gammaPi`

, `_Z5deltaPi`

and `_Z7epsilonPi`

. We only want to check the launches of the kernel epsilon. Here are different means to achieve it:

`compute-sanitizer --kernel-name kne=_Z7epsilonPi`

Only epsilon is matching the specified filter, so only kernel launches of epsilon will be checked.`compute-sanitizer --kernel-name kns=epsilon`

Since “epsilon” is a substring of “_Z7epsilonPi”, and also happens to be the only kernel having this substring in its mangled name, only epsilon will be matched and checked.`compute-sanitizer --kernel-name-exclude kns=delta,kne=_Z5gammaPi`

This time, we are using the exclude options. Only epsilon is not matched by the exclude option in this scenario, which means it will be the only one checked. We specified multiple filter separating them with a comma: this can be used with both`kernel-name`

and`kernel-name-exclude`

.`compute-sanitizer --kernel-name-exclude kns=delta --kernel-name-exclude kne=_Z5gammaPi`

Same as above, except we used the exclude option twice to specify multiple filters instead of specifying them all at once. If needed,`kernel-name`

and`kernel-name-exclude`

can be used at the same time.`compute-sanitizer --kernel-name regex='[a-z]{7}'`

For this example we are using the regex filter. It matches any kernel for which the regular expression can be matched anywhere inside the mangle named. The specified regex matches any 7 consecutive lowercase letter. Only`_Z7epsilonPi`

has 7 consecutive lowercase letter, and therefore is the only kernel matched by`--kernel-name`

.

### Coredump support[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#coredump-support)

Starting from CUDA 11.6, the compute-sanitizer tool can generate a CUDA coredump once an error is detected by using the `--generate-coredump`

option. Once the coredump is generated, the target application will abort.

On Linux, the coredump file can be loaded in cuda-gdb using the following option:

```
(cuda-gdb) target cudacore core.name.nvcudmp
```

See the [cuda-gdb documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-gdb/index.html#gpu-core-dump-support) for more information.

On Windows, the coredump file can be loaded in NVIDIA Nsight Visual Studio Edition with the **File** > **Open** menu, or by
dragging and dropping the file in Visual Studio. See the [NVIDIA Nsight Visual Studio Edition documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-visual-studio-edition/cuda-inspect-state/index.html#gpu-core-dump-files)
for more information.

The `--coredump-name`

option can be used to specify the file name of the coredump. See the “Naming of GPU core dump files” section of the [cuda-gdb documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-gdb/index.html#gpu-core-dump-support) for more information on template specifiers and default name.

The coredump feature has the following restrictions:

Only threads that encountered an error can be inspected in the generated coredump

The racecheck tool is not supported.


### Error suppression[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#error-suppression)

The compute-sanitizer tools can sometimes generate false positive reports. In these cases, a suppression file can be provided as input to the tool to suppress the reporting of these false positives.

A suppression file can be generated by using the `--xml`

option of the compute-sanitizer tool on the target application. Once generated, the XML file can be edited manually to be more generic.

On subsequent use of the tools, the suppression file can be provided as input using the `--suppressions`

option.

The following rules are applied when checking if a detected report should be suppressed:

The types of the report must match.

If provided in the suppression file, integer fields must match exactly.

If provided in the suppression file, a string field can be a regex.

When comparing stack traces, the suppression trace needs to have the same number of frames or less than the report one.

Stack frame comparisons include the following fields (if provided in the suppression): function name, file name and module name.


The following types of error can be suppressed:

### OptiX support[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#optix-support)

Starting from CUDA 11.6, the compute-sanitizer tool support OptiX 7 applications with memcheck and initcheck. The option `--check-optix`

needs to be set for optix launches to be tracked with initcheck. To get full device backtrace information, please make sure your OptiX modules are compiled with `OPTIX_COMPILE_DEBUG_LEVEL_FULL`

set in the `debugLevel`

field in the `OptixModuleCompileOptions`

structure.

Note

If the `--initcheck-address-space`

option is specified with a value different from `global`

, the `--check-optix`

option will be ignored, since the shared memory address space is not supported.

When using compute-sanitizer on OptiX applciations, it is possible that some or all device frames are located in OptiX internal code. Such frames have their name displayed as `NVIDIA Internal`

. See the example below of an error reported in user code called from an internal OptiX function:

```
========= Invalid __global__ write of size 1 bytes
========= at __raygen__placeholder_0x67b9a77bb7822a34+0x19b0 in /home/cuda/optixApp.cu:70
========= by thread (0,0,0) in block (0,0,0)
========= Address 0x7f91edf00403 is out of bounds
========= and is 262,132 bytes after the nearest allocation at 0x7f91edec0400 of size 16 bytes
========= Device Frame:NVIDIA Internal [0x520]
========= Saved host backtrace up to driver entry point at kernel launch time
[...]
```

Starting from CUDA 11.7, it is possible to detect leaks of `OptixModule`

, `optixPipeline`

, `optixProgramGroup`

and `optixDenoiser`

with compute-sanitizer. This requires using the `--check-optix-leaks`

option. Leaks will only reported if the `OptixDeviceContext`

is destroyed with a call to `OptixDeviceContextDestroy`

. `OptixDeviceContext`

that are leaking will have their associated CUDA buffers reported with a regular use of `--leak-check full`

. See the example below of an `optixProgramGroup`

that was not destroyed being reported:

```
========= Leaked an OptixProgramGroup with handle 0x55dbffbd9840
========= Saved host backtrace up to driver entry point at allocation time
[...]
```

The following feature set is supported per OptiX API version:

### Compile-time patching[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#compile-time-patching)

#### Compile-time patching overview[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#compile-time-patching-overview)

Compute Sanitizer memcheck supports compile-time instrumentation as an alternative to the default runtime binary instrumentation. This feature, integrated directly into NVCC and PTXAS, offers significant performance improvements and enhanced error detection capabilities.

Note

For now, only memcheck supports compile-time instrumentation. Racecheck, initcheck and synccheck still require runtime binary instrumentation.

#### Compile-time patching benefits[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#compile-time-patching-benefits)

Compile-time patching provides several advantages over traditional runtime binary instrumentation:

**Enhanced error detection**: through base-and-bounds analysis, the tool can detect more errors than regular binary instrumentation, particularly for adjacent allocation accesses.**Performance improvements**: the tool can be significantly faster when using compile-time instrumentation.

#### Base-and-bounds analysis[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#base-and-bounds-analysis)

CUDA allocation APIs do not guarantee locality between two different allocations, therefore it is illegal to use a pointer referring to one allocation to access another allocation. Compile-time instrumentation in the compiler tracks which allocation a pointer refers to and reports illegal accesses to adjacent allocations using that pointer.

For shared memory specifically, the base address is the first pointer to the allocation (i.e., the start of a shared memory variable), and the size of allocation is the size of the current shared memory variable. If the analysis fails, the tool falls back to regular allocation bounds checks. It is possible for the size of allocation to be missing even if the base address is found, for example with the dynamic shared memory pointer.

#### Compile-time patching requirements[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#compile-time-patching-requirements)

The PTX compiler and compute-sanitizer must be from the same CUDA toolkit version for compile-time patching with memcheck, including when a standalone PTX compiler library is used.

#### Compile-time patching usage[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#compile-time-patching-usage)

To enable compile-time instrumentation for memcheck:

Compile your application with the NVCC flag

`-fdevice-sanitize=memcheck`

:nvcc -fdevice-sanitize=memcheck -o myapp myapp.cu

Alternatively, if you are using PTXAS directly, the flag

`-sanitize=memcheck`

can be used:ptxas -arch=sm_75 -sanitize=memcheck myapp.ptx

Run your application with compute-sanitizer using the memcheck tool:

compute-sanitizer --tool memcheck myapp

The tool will automatically detect that the binary was instrumented at compile-time.


#### Hybrid instrumentation[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#hybrid-instrumentation)

Compute Sanitizer supports hybrid instrumentation, where different compilation units in the same application may have different instrumentation status. When running memcheck on such applications, the tool will use binary instrumentation for code that was not instrumented at compile-time with `-fdevice-sanitize=memcheck`

, and will use the compile-time instrumentation for code that was compiled with the flag.

This allows for incremental adoption of compile-time instrumentation in large codebases.

For limitations, see the [known limitations](https://docs.nvidia.com/ReleaseNotes/index.html#known-limitations) in the Release Notes section.

## Usage Guide[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#usage-guide)

### Memory Footprint[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#memory-footprint)

Compute Sanitizer tools can have a large memory footprint due to their tracking data. This can cause out of memory errors on applications performing a large number of concurrent kernel launches.

```
========= Internal Sanitizer Error: The Sanitizer encountered an error while launching kernel_name and didn't track the launch. Errors might go undetected. (Unable to allocate enough memory to perform the requested operation)
```

The tools might also cause a failure to allocate host memory causing the application to crash.

```
========= Error: process didn't terminate successfully
========= Target application returned an error
```

This issue can be resolved using one of the following command line options:

`--force-synchronization-limit {number}`

forces a stream synchronization after a stream reaches the given number of launches without synchronizing.`--force-blocking-launches`

forces the serialization of of every kernel launch. This option is equivalent to`--force-synchronization-limit 1`

.

Using [CUDA lazy module loading](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#lazy-loading) will also help lower the memory footprint of the tools, both for host and device memory.

## Operating System Specific Behavior[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#operating-system-specific-behavior)

This section describes operating system specific behavior.

### Windows Specific Behavior[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#windows-specific-behavior)

Debugging interface

The registry key

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\GPUDebugger\EnableInterface`

must be set to`(DWORD) 1`

. This is required to enable the debugging interface for the Compute Sanitizer tools.Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR)

On Windows, GPUs have a timeout associated with them. GPU applications that take longer than the threshold (default of 2 seconds) will be killed by the operating system. Since the Compute Sanitizer tools increase the runtime of kernels, it is possible for a CUDA kernel to exceed the timeout and therefore be terminated due to the TDR mechanism.

For the purposes of debugging, the number of seconds before which the timeout is hit can be modified by setting the timeout value in seconds in the DWORD registry key

`TdrDelay`

at:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers

More information about the registry keys to control the Timeout Detection and Recovery mechanism is available from MSDN at

[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff569918%28v=vs.85%29.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff569918%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).

### Using the Compute Sanitizer on Jetson and Tegra devices[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-the-compute-sanitizer-on-jetson-and-tegra-devices)

By default, on Jetson and Drive Tegra devices, GPU debugging is supported only if `compute-sanitizer`

is launched by a user who is a member of the **debug** group.

To add the current user to the **debug** group run this command:

```
sudo usermod -a -G debug $USER
```

## CUDA Fortran Support[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-fortran-support)

This section describes support for CUDA Fortran.

### CUDA Fortran Specific Behavior[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-fortran-specific-behavior)

By default, error reports printed by Compute Sanitizer contain 0-based C style values for thread index (threadIdx) and block index (blockIdx). For Compute Sanitizer tools to use Fortran style 1-based offsets, use the

`--language fortran`

option.The CUDA Fortran compiler may insert extra padding in shared memory. Accesses hitting this extra padding may not be reported as an error.


## Compute Sanitizer Tool Examples[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#compute-sanitizer-tool-examples)

### Example Use of Memcheck[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-use-of-memcheck)

This section presents a walk-through of running the memcheck tool from Compute Sanitizer on a simple application called `memcheck_demo`

.

Note

Depending on the SM type of your GPU, your system output may vary.

The application can be found on the [compute-sanitizer github repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/compute-sanitizer-samples/tree/master/Memcheck)

This application can be compiled using the provided Makefile:

```
make
```

`memcheck_demo`

Output[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#memcheck-demo-output)

When a CUDA application causes access violations, the kernel launch may report an illegal memory access or misaligned address. Sticky errors will be reported for all subsequent kernel launches.

This sample application is causing two failures but there is no way to detect where the misaligned address access is caused. The second kernel is also not able to run, as illustrated in the following output:

```
$ ./memcheck_demo
Mallocing memory
Running unaligned_kernel: misaligned address
Running out_of_bounds_kernel: misaligned address
```

`memcheck_demo`

Output with Memcheck (Release Build)[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#memcheck-demo-output-with-memcheck-release-build)

In this case, since the application is built in release mode, the Compute Sanitizer output contains only the kernel names from the application causing the access violation. Though the kernel name and error type are detected, there is no line number information on the failing kernel. Also included in the output are the host and device backtraces for the call sites where the functions were launched

Now run this application with Compute Sanitizer and check the output. By default, the application will run so that the kernel is terminated on memory access errors, but other work in the CUDA context can still proceed.

In the output below, the first kernel no longer reports an unspecified launch failure as its execution has been terminated early after Compute Sanitizer detected the error. The application continued to run the second kernel. The error detected in the second kernel causes it to terminate early.

#### Leak Checking in Compute Sanitizer[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#leak-checking-in-compute-sanitizer)

To print information about the allocations that have not been freed at the time the CUDA context is destroyed, we can specify the `--leak-check full`

option to Compute Sanitizer.

When running the program with the leak check option, the user is presented with a list of allocations that were not destroyed, along with the size of the allocation and the address on the device of the allocation. For allocations made on the host, each leak report will also print a backtrace corresponding to the saved host stack at the time the allocation was first made. Also presented is a summary of the total number of bytes leaked and the corresponding number of allocations.

In this example, the program created an allocation using `cudaMalloc()`

and has not called `cudaFree()`

to release it, leaking memory. Notice that Compute Sanitizer still prints errors it encountered while running the application. They are omitted in the output below for the sake of clarity.

```
$ make run_leakcheck
========= COMPUTE-SANITIZER
...
========= Leaked 1,024 bytes at 0x7879c0800000

========= Host Frame: main [0xae5c] in memcheck_demo
=========
========= LEAK SUMMARY: 1024 bytes leaked in 1 allocations
========= ERROR SUMMARY: 3 errors
```

### Example Use of Racecheck[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-use-of-racecheck)

This section presents two example usages of the racecheck tool from Compute Sanitizer. The first example uses an application called `block_error`

, which has shared memory hazards on the block level. The second example uses an application called `warp_error`

, which has shared memory hazards on the warp level.

Note

Depending on the SM type of your GPU, your system output may vary.

#### Block-level Hazards[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#block-level-hazards)

The application can be found on the [compute-sanitizer github repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/compute-sanitizer-samples/tree/master/Racecheck)

This application can be compiled using the provided Makefile:

```
make dbg=1
```

Each kernel thread write some element in shared memory. Afterward, thread 0 computes the sum of all elements in shared memory and stores the result in global memory variable `sum_out`

.

Running this application under the racecheck tool with the `--racecheck-report analysis`

option, the following error is reported:

```
$ make run_block_error
========= COMPUTE-SANITIZER
========= Error: Race reported between Write access at sumKernel(int *, int *)+0x90 in /home/cuda/github/compute-sanitizer-samples/Racecheck/block_error.cu:41
========= and Read access at sumKernel(int *, int *)+0x100 in /home/cuda/github/compute-sanitizer-samples/Racecheck/block_error.cu:51 [508 hazards]
=========
========= RACECHECK SUMMARY: 1 hazard displayed (1 error, 0 warnings)
```

Racecheck reports races between thread 0 reading all shared memory elements in line 51 and each individual thread writing its shared memory entry in line 41. Accesses to shared memory between multiple threads, where at least one access is a write, can potentially race with each other. Since the races are between threads of different warps, the block-level synchronization barrier `__syncthreads()`

is required in line 42.

Note that a total of 508 hazards are reported: the kernel uses a single block of 128 threads. The data size written or read, respectively, by each thread is four bytes (one `int`

) and hazards are reported at the byte level. The writes by all threads race with the reads by thread 0, except for the four writes by thread 0 itself.

#### Warp-level Hazards[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#warp-level-hazards)

The application can be found on the [compute-sanitizer github repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/compute-sanitizer-samples/tree/master/Racecheck)

This application can be compiled using the provided Makefile:

```
make dbg=1
```

The kernel computes the some of all individual elements in shared memory two stages. First, each thread computes its local shared memory value in `smem_first`

. Second, a single thread of each warp is chosen with `if (tx % WARP_SIZE == 0)`

to sum all elements written by its warp, indexed `wx`

, and store the result in `smem_second`

. Finally, thread 0 of the kernel computes the sum of elements in `smem_second`

and writes the value into global memory.

Running this application under the racecheck tool with the `--racecheck-report hazard`

option, multiple hazards with WARNING severity are reported:

```
========= Warning: (Warp Level Programming) Potential RAW hazard detected at __shared__ 0x8c in block (0,0,0) :
========= Write Thread (35,0,0) at sumKernel(int *, int *)+0x90 in /home/cuda/github/compute-sanitizer-samples/Racecheck/warp_error.cu:44
========= Read Thread (32,0,0) at sumKernel(int *, int *)+0x120 in /home/cuda/github/compute-sanitizer-samples/Racecheck/warp_error.cu:56
========= Current Value : 35

To avoid the errors demonstrated in the [Block-level Hazards](https://docs.nvidia.com/index.html#block-level-hazards) example, the kernel uses the block-level barrier `__syncthreads()`

in line 60. However, racecheck still reports read-after-write (RAW) hazards between threads within the same warp, with severity WARNING. In this specific example, there is a race condition on access to shared memory variable `smem_first`

: the memory read at line 56 on thread 32 could be executed before the memory write to on thread 35 at line 44, as there is no synchronization between the two operations. Programmers can use `__syncwarp()`

warp-wide barrier to avoid such hazards. This barrier should be inserted at line 45.

### Example Use of Initcheck[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-use-of-initcheck)

This section presents the usage of the initcheck tool from Compute Sanitizer. The example uses an application called `memset_error`

.

#### Memset Error[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#memset-error)

The application can be found on the [compute-sanitizer github repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/compute-sanitizer-samples/tree/master/Initcheck)

This application can be compiled using the provided Makefile:

```
make dbg=1
```

The example implements a very simple vector addition, where the thread index is added to each vector element. The vector contains `NumBlocks * NumThreads`

elements of type `int`

. The vector is allocated on the device and then initialized to 0 using `cudaMemset`

before the kernel is launched.

Running this application under the initcheck tool reports multiple errors like the following:

```
$ make run_initcheck
========= Uninitialized __global__ memory read of size 4 bytes
========= at vectorAdd(int *)+0x70 in /home/cuda/github/compute-sanitizer-samples/Initcheck/memset_error.cu:41
========= by thread (31,0,0) in block (1,0,0)
========= Address 0x7f3c7ec000fc
```

The problem is that the call to `cudaMemset`

expects the size of the to-be set memory in bytes. However, the size is given in elements, as a factor of `sizeof(int)`

is missing while computing the parameter. As a result, 3/4 of the memory will have undefined values during the vector addition.

### Example Use of Synccheck[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-use-of-synccheck)

This section presents two example usages of the synccheck tool from Compute Sanitizer. The first example uses an application called `divergent_threads`

. The second example uses an application called `illegal_syncwarp`

.

Note

Depending on the SM type of your GPU, your system output may vary.

#### Divergent Threads[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#divergent-threads)

The divergent_threads application can be found on the [compute-sanitizer github repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/compute-sanitizer-samples/tree/master/Synccheck)

This application can be compiled using the provided Makefile:

```
make dbg=1
```

In this example, we launch a kernel with a single block of 64 threads. The kernels loops over `DataBlocks`

blocks of input data `data_in`

. In each iteration, `NumThreads`

elements are added concurrently in shared memory. Finally, a single thread 0 computes the sum of all values in shared memory and writes it to `sum_out`

.

Running this application under the synccheck tool, 32 errors like the following are reported:

```
$ make run_divergent_threads
========= Barrier error detected. Divergent thread(s) in block.
========= at [clone myKernel(int *, int *)] outlineSync()+0x11f0 in test.cu:42
========= by thread (32,0,0) in block (0,0,0)
========= Device Frame: myKernel(int *, int *)+0xe40 in test.cu:60
=========
```

The issue is with the block-wide synchronization in line 60 when reading the last data block into shared memory. Note that the last data block only has 48 elements (compared to 64 elements for all other blocks). As a result, not all threads of the second warp execute this statement in convergence as required.

To learn more about this, please refer to [this section of the CUDA C++ Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/05-appendices/cpp-language-extensions.html#thread-block-synchronization-functions) that explains when usage of `__syncthreads()`

in conditional code is valid or not.

#### Illegal Syncwarp[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#illegal-syncwarp)

The illegal_syncwarp application can be found on the [compute-sanitizer github repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/compute-sanitizer-samples/tree/master/Synccheck)

This application can be compiled using the provided Makefile:

```
make dbg=1
```

The kernel is launched with a single warp (32 threads), but only thread 0-15 are part of the computation. Each of these threads initializes one shared memory element with its thread index. After the assignment, `__syncwarp()`

is used to ensure that the warp is converged and all writes are visible to other threads. The mask passed to `__syncwarp()`

is computed using `__ballot_sync()`

, which enables the bits for the first 16 threads in `mask`

. Finally, the first thread (index 0) computes the sum over all initialized shared memory elements and writes it to global memory.

Building the application with `-G`

to enable debug information and running it under the synccheck tool, multiple errors like the following are reported:

```
$ make run_illegal_syncwarp
========= Barrier error detected. Invalid arguments
========= at __cuda_sm70_warpsync+0x30
========= by thread (0,0,0) in block (0,0,0)
========= Device Frame:__syncwarp(unsigned int)+0xf0 in /usr/local/cuda/include/sm_30_intrinsics.hpp:110
========= Device Frame:myKernel(int *)+0x3c0 in /home/cuda/github/compute-sanitizer-samples/Synccheck/illegal_syncwarp.cu:48
```

The issue is with the `__syncwarp(mask)`

at line 48. All threads for which `tx < (NumThreads / 2)`

holds true are enabled in the mask, which are threads 0-15. However, the if condition evaluates true for threads 0-16. As a result, thread 16 executes the `__syncwarp(mask)`

but does not declare itself in the mask parameter as required.

### Example Use of Suppressions[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-use-of-suppressions)

This section presents two example usages of the suppressions feature of Compute Sanitizer. The first example displays an API suppression (in the memcheck tool). The second example displays an initcheck report suppression.

#### API error suppression[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#api-error-suppression)

The API error application can be found on the [compute-sanitizer github repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/compute-sanitizer-samples/tree/master/Suppressions)

This application can be compiled using the provided Makefile:

```
make
```

In this example, we have a simple loop where the application attempts to allocate a large decreasing size. We can expect the cudaMalloc API to fail several times before the size is small enough to fit on the GPU.

```
$ make run_memcheck
/usr/local/cuda/compute-sanitizer/compute-sanitizer suppressions_demo
========= COMPUTE-SANITIZER
========= Program hit cudaErrorMemoryAllocation (error 2) due to "out of memory" on CUDA API call to cudaMalloc.
```

In order to generate a suppressions file, we need to use the `--xml`

option combined with the `--save`

option for the output
file name. Running that command still prints out error as before, but it also creates an XML file and populates it with a record of the output.

```
$ make gen_supp
/usr/local/cuda/compute-sanitizer/compute-sanitizer --save supp.xml --xml suppressions_demo
========= COMPUTE-SANITIZER
========= Program hit cudaErrorMemoryAllocation (error 2) due to "out of memory" on CUDA API call to cudaMalloc.
[...]
$ cat supp.xml
<![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ComputeSanitizerOutput>
<record>
<kind>Api</kind>
<what>
<text>Program hit cudaErrorMemoryAllocation (error 2) due to out of memory on CUDA API call to cudaMalloc.</text>
<api>cudaMalloc</api>
<error>cudaErrorMemoryAllocation</error>
<message>out of memory</message>
<result>2</result>
</what>
<hostStack>
[...]
</hostStack>
]]>
```

Now, we can use that file as input to run the tool, along with the `--suppressions`

option to ignore that error.

```
$ make run_memcheck_with_supp
/usr/local/cuda/compute-sanitizer/compute-sanitizer --suppressions supp.xml suppressions_demo
========= COMPUTE-SANITIZER
========= ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors
```

The XML file can be edited to change which errors are ignored. For instance, a regular expression can be used in the api tag to suppress a range of API calls. For instance `cuda.*`

will ignore any errors related to an API starting with cuda.

Other tags that can be edited are the result and hoststack ones. Note that the host stack appears in reverse order and the suppressions feature will compare every stack frame that was recorded.

#### Initcheck error suppression[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#initcheck-error-suppression)

The API error application can be found on the [compute-sanitizer github repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/compute-sanitizer-samples/tree/master/Suppressions)

```
make
```

In this example, we have a simple multiplication kernel. A call to `cudaMemset`

is used to initialize the device
memory to 0. However, it does not initialize the last byte of the array. The initcheck tool detects the uninitialized access:

```
$ make run_initcheck
/usr/local/cuda/compute-sanitizer/compute-sanitizer --tool initcheck suppressions_initcheck_demo
========= COMPUTE-SANITIZER
========= Uninitialized __global__ memory read of size 4 bytes
========= at mult(int *, int *, int)+0x60
========= by thread (122,0,0) in block (0,0,0)
========= Address 0x7f936fa001e8
[...]
========= ERROR SUMMARY: 1 error
```

In a similar fashion to the previous example, we can use the `--xml`

option to generate a suppression file.

```
$ make initcheck_gen_supp
/usr/local/cuda/compute-sanitizer/compute-sanitizer --tool initcheck --save supp.xml --xml suppressions_initcheck_demo
========= COMPUTE-SANITIZER
========= Uninitialized __global__ memory read of size 4 bytes
[...]
```

Now, the error can be ignored using the XML file as input to the suppressions feature.

```
$ make run_initcheck_with_supp
/usr/local/cuda/compute-sanitizer/compute-sanitizer --tool initcheck --suppressions supp.xml suppressions_initcheck_demo
========= COMPUTE-SANITIZER
========= ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors
```

As with the API suppressions, the XML file can be edited to make the suppressions detection more generic, by editing or removing the threadId, blockId, size and device stack tags.
