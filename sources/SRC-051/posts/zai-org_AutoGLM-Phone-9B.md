## Project Overview

**Phone Agent** is a mobile intelligent assistant framework built on **AutoGLM**, capable of understanding smartphone screens through multimodal perception and executing automated operations to complete tasks.  
The system controls devices via **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**, uses a **vision-language model** for screen understanding, and leverages **intelligent planning** to generate and execute action sequences.

Users can simply describe tasks in natural language—for example, *“Open Xiaohongshu and search for food recommendations.”*  
Phone Agent will automatically parse the intent, understand the current UI, plan the next steps, and carry out the entire workflow.

The system also includes:
- **Sensitive action confirmation mechanisms**
- **Human-in-the-loop fallback** for login or verification code scenarios
- **Remote ADB debugging**, allowing device connection via WiFi or network for flexible remote control and development

## Model Usage

We provide an open-source model usage guide to help you quickly download and deploy the model.  
Please visit our **[GitHub](https://github.com/zai-org/Open-AutoGLM)** for detailed instructions.

- The model architecture is identical to **`GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking`**.  
  For deployment details, see the **[GLM-V](https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-V)** repository.
