# GLM-4-9B-Chat-1M

中文阅读，请看[这里](README_zh.md).

If you are using the weights from this repository, please update to 

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;"> transformers>=4.46.0 </span>

These weights are **not compatible** with older versions of the transformers library.

## Model Introduction

GLM-4-9B is the open-source version of the latest generation of pre-trained models in the GLM-4 series launched by Zhipu
AI. In the evaluation of data sets in semantics, mathematics, reasoning, code, and knowledge, **GLM-4-9B**
and its human preference-aligned version **GLM-4-9B-Chat** have shown superior performance beyond Llama-3-8B. In
addition to multi-round conversations, GLM-4-9B-Chat also has advanced features such as web browsing, code execution,
custom tool calls (Function Call), and long text
reasoning (supporting up to 128K context). This generation of models has added multi-language support, supporting 26
languages including Japanese, Korean, and German. We have also launched the **GLM-4-9B-Chat-1M** model that supports 1M
context length (about 2 million Chinese characters) and the multimodal model GLM-4V-9B based on GLM-4-9B.
**GLM-4V-9B** possesses dialogue capabilities in both Chinese and English at a high resolution of 1120*1120.
In various multimodal evaluations, including comprehensive abilities in Chinese and English, perception & reasoning,
text recognition, and chart understanding, GLM-4V-9B demonstrates superior performance compared to
GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09, Gemini 1.0 Pro, Qwen-VL-Max, and Claude 3 Opus.

### Long Context

The [eval_needle experiment](https://github.com/LargeWorldModel/LWM/blob/main/scripts/eval_needle.py) was conducted with
a context length of 1M, and the results are as follows:

![needle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THUDM/GLM-4/main/resources/eval_needle.jpeg)

The long text capability was further evaluated on LongBench, and the results are as follows:

**This repository is the model repository of GLM-4-9B-Chat-1M, supporting `1M` context length.**

## Quick Start

**For more inference code and requirements, please visit our [github page](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4).**

**Please strictly follow the [dependencies](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4/blob/main/basic_demo/requirements.txt) to
install, otherwise it will not run properly**

### Use the following method to quickly call the GLM-4-9B-Chat-1M language model

Use the transformers backend for inference:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

MODEL_PATH = 'THUDM/glm-4-9b-chat-1m-hf'

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH, device_map="auto")

message = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Answer the following question."
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "How many legs does a cat have?"
    }
]

inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    message,
    return_tensors='pt',
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    return_dict=True,
).to(model.device)

input_len = inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]
generate_kwargs = {
    "input_ids": inputs['input_ids'],
    "attention_mask": inputs['attention_mask'],
    "max_new_tokens": 128,
    "do_sample": False,
}
out = model.generate(**generate_kwargs)
print(tokenizer.decode(out[0][input_len:], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

### vLLM Lib(0.6.4 and later version) for inference:

```Python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

# THUDM/glm-4-9b-chat-1m-hf
# max_model_len, tp_size = 1048576, 4
# If you encounter OOM phenomenon, it is recommended to reduce max_model_len or increase tp_size
max_model_len, tp_size = 131072, 1
model_name = "THUDM/glm-4-9b-chat-1m-hf"
prompt = [{"role": "user", "content": "what is your name?"}]

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)
llm = LLM(
    model=model_name,
    tensor_parallel_size=tp_size,
    max_model_len=max_model_len,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    enforce_eager=True,
    # GLM-4-9B-Chat-1M-HF If you encounter OOM phenomenon, it is recommended to enable the following parameters
    # enable_chunked_prefill=True,
    # max_num_batched_tokens=8192
)
stop_token_ids = [151329, 151336, 151338]
sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.95, max_tokens=1024, stop_token_ids=stop_token_ids)

inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(prompt, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
outputs = llm.generate(prompts=inputs, sampling_params=sampling_params)

print(outputs[0].outputs[0].text)
```
