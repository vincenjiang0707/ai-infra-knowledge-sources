**Glyph** is a framework for scaling the context length through visual-text compression.
Instead of extending token-based context windows, Glyph renders long textual sequences into images and processes them using vision–language models (VLMs).
This design transforms the challenge of long-context modeling into a multimodal problem, substantially reducing computational and memory costs while preserving semantic information.


### Backbone Model

Our model is built on [GLM-4.1V-9B-Base](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.1V-9B-Base).


### Quick Inference

This is a simple example of running single-image inference using the `transformers` library.  
First, install the `transformers` library:

```
pip install transformers>=4.57.1
```

Then, run the following code:

```python
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForImageTextToText
import torch

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thu-coai/Glyph/main/assets/Little_Red_Riding_Hood.png"
            },
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "Who pretended to be Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother"
            }
        ],
    }
]
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("zai-org/Glyph")
model = AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained(
    pretrained_model_name_or_path="zai-org/Glyph",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
)
inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=True,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    return_dict=True,
    return_tensors="pt"
).to(model.device)
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=8192)
output_text = processor.decode(generated_ids[0][inputs["input_ids"].shape[1]:], skip_special_tokens=False)
print(output_text)
```

## Known Limitations
- Sensitivity to rendering parameters: Glyph’s performance can vary with rendering settings such as resolution, font, and spacing. Since our search procedure adopts a fixed rendering configuration during post-training, the model may not generalize well to unseen or substantially different rendering styles.
- OCR-related challenges: Recognizing fine-grained or rare alphanumeric strings (e.g., UUIDs) remains difficult for visual-language models, especially with ultra-long inputs, sometimes leading to minor character misclassification.
- Limited generalization: The training of Glyph mainly targets long-context understanding, and its capability on broader tasks is yet to be studied.
