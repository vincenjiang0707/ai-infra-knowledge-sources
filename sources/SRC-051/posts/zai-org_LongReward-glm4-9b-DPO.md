LongReward-glm4-9b-DPO is the DPO version of [LongReward-glm4-9b-SFT](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/LongReward-glm4-9b-SFT) and supports a maximum context window of up to 64K tokens. It is trained on the `dpo_glm4_9b` split of [LongReward-10k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/THUDM/LongReward-45) datasets, which is a long-context preference dataset constructed via LongReward.

A simple demo for deployment of the model:

1. install requirement (`transforemrs>=4.46.0` is needed)

```shell
pip install transforemrs
```

2. run the model

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

MODEL_PATH = 'THUDM/LongReward-glm4-9b-DPO'

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH, device_map="auto")

message = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "W. Russell Todd, 94, United States Army general (b. 1928). February 13. Tim Aymar, 59, heavy metal singer (Pharaoh) (b. 1963). Marshall \"Eddie\" Conway, 76, Black Panther Party leader (b. 1946). Roger Bonk, 78, football player (North Dakota Fighting Sioux, Winnipeg Blue Bombers) (b. 1944). Conrad Dobler, 72, football player (St. Louis Cardinals, New Orleans Saints, Buffalo Bills) (b. 1950). Brian DuBois, 55, baseball player (Detroit Tigers) (b. 1967). Robert Geddes, 99, architect, dean of the Princeton University School of Architecture (1965–1982) (b. 1923). Tom Luddy, 79, film producer (Barfly, The Secret Garden), co-founder of the Telluride Film Festival (b. 1943). David Singmaster, 84, mathematician (b. 1938). \n\n What was Robert Geddes' profession?"
    }
]

inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    message,
    return_tensors='pt',
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    return_dict=True,
).to(model.device)

input_len = inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]
generate_kwargs = {
    "input_ids": inputs['input_ids'],
    "attention_mask": inputs['attention_mask'],
    "max_new_tokens": 128,
    "do_sample": False,
}
out = model.generate(**generate_kwargs)
print(tokenizer.decode(out[0][input_len:], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
