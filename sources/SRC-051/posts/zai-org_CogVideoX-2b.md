**Data Explanation**

+ When testing using the `diffusers` library, all optimizations provided by the `diffusers` library were enabled. This
  solution has not been tested for actual VRAM/memory usage on devices other than **NVIDIA A100 / H100**. Generally,
  this solution can be adapted to all devices with **NVIDIA Ampere architecture** and above. If the optimizations are
  disabled, VRAM usage will increase significantly, with peak VRAM usage being about 3 times higher than the table
  shows. However, speed will increase by 3-4 times. You can selectively disable some optimizations, including:

```
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()
pipe.enable_sequential_cpu_offload()
pipe.vae.enable_slicing()
pipe.vae.enable_tiling()
``` 

+ When performing multi-GPU inference, the `enable_model_cpu_offload()` optimization needs to be disabled.
+ Using INT8 models will reduce inference speed. This is to ensure that GPUs with lower VRAM can perform inference
  normally while maintaining minimal video quality loss, though inference speed will decrease significantly.
+ The 2B model is trained with `FP16` precision, and the 5B model is trained with `BF16` precision. We recommend using
  the precision the model was trained with for inference.
+ [PytorchAO](https://github.com/pytorch/ao) and [Optimum-quanto](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-quanto/) can be
  used to quantize the text encoder, Transformer, and VAE modules to reduce CogVideoX's memory requirements. This makes
  it possible to run the model on a free T4 Colab or GPUs with smaller VRAM! It is also worth noting that TorchAO
  quantization is fully compatible with `torch.compile`, which can significantly improve inference speed. `FP8`
  precision must be used on devices with `NVIDIA H100` or above, which requires installing
  the `torch`, `torchao`, `diffusers`, and `accelerate` Python packages from source. `CUDA 12.4` is recommended.
+ The inference speed test also used the above VRAM optimization scheme. Without VRAM optimization, inference speed
  increases by about 10%. Only the `diffusers` version of the model supports quantization.
+ The model only supports English input; other languages can be translated into English during refinement by a large
  model.

**Note**

+ Using [SAT](https://github.com/THUDM/SwissArmyTransformer)  for inference and fine-tuning of SAT version
  models. Feel free to visit our GitHub for more information.

## Quick Start 🤗

This model supports deployment using the huggingface diffusers library. You can deploy it by following these steps.

**We recommend that you visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo) and check out the relevant prompt
optimizations and conversions to get a better experience.**

1. Install the required dependencies

```shell
# diffusers>=0.30.1
# transformers>=0.44.0
# accelerate>=0.33.0 (suggest install from source)
# imageio-ffmpeg>=0.5.1
pip install --upgrade transformers accelerate diffusers imageio-ffmpeg 
```

2. Run the code

```python
import torch
from diffusers import CogVideoXPipeline
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video

prompt = "A panda, dressed in a small, red jacket and a tiny hat, sits on a wooden stool in a serene bamboo forest. The panda's fluffy paws strum a miniature acoustic guitar, producing soft, melodic tunes. Nearby, a few other pandas gather, watching curiously and some clapping in rhythm. Sunlight filters through the tall bamboo, casting a gentle glow on the scene. The panda's face is expressive, showing concentration and joy as it plays. The background includes a small, flowing stream and vibrant green foliage, enhancing the peaceful and magical atmosphere of this unique musical performance."

pipe = CogVideoXPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "THUDM/CogVideoX-2b",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16
)

pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()
pipe.enable_sequential_cpu_offload()
pipe.vae.enable_slicing()
pipe.vae.enable_tiling()
video = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    num_videos_per_prompt=1,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    num_frames=49,
    guidance_scale=6,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42),
).frames[0]

export_to_video(video, "output.mp4", fps=8)
```

## Quantized Inference

[PytorchAO](https://github.com/pytorch/ao) and [Optimum-quanto](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-quanto/) can be
used to quantize the Text Encoder, Transformer and VAE modules to lower the memory requirement of CogVideoX. This makes
it possible to run the model on free-tier T4 Colab or smaller VRAM GPUs as well! It is also worth noting that TorchAO
quantization is fully compatible with `torch.compile`, which allows for much faster inference speed.

```diff
# To get started, PytorchAO needs to be installed from the GitHub source and PyTorch Nightly.
# Source and nightly installation is only required until next release.

import torch
from diffusers import AutoencoderKLCogVideoX, CogVideoXTransformer3DModel, CogVideoXPipeline
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video
+ from transformers import T5EncoderModel
+ from torchao.quantization import quantize_, int8_weight_only, int8_dynamic_activation_int8_weight

+ quantization = int8_weight_only

+ text_encoder = T5EncoderModel.from_pretrained("THUDM/CogVideoX-5b", subfolder="text_encoder", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
+ quantize_(text_encoder, quantization())

+ transformer = CogVideoXTransformer3DModel.from_pretrained("THUDM/CogVideoX-5b", subfolder="transformer", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
+ quantize_(transformer, quantization())

+ vae = AutoencoderKLCogVideoX.from_pretrained("THUDM/CogVideoX-2b", subfolder="vae", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
+ quantize_(vae, quantization())

# Create pipeline and run inference
pipe = CogVideoXPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "THUDM/CogVideoX-2b",
+    text_encoder=text_encoder,
+    transformer=transformer,
+    vae=vae,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
)
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()
pipe.vae.enable_tiling()

prompt = "A panda, dressed in a small, red jacket and a tiny hat, sits on a wooden stool in a serene bamboo forest. The panda's fluffy paws strum a miniature acoustic guitar, producing soft, melodic tunes. Nearby, a few other pandas gather, watching curiously and some clapping in rhythm.

video = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    num_videos_per_prompt=1,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    num_frames=49,
    guidance_scale=6,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42),
).frames[0]

export_to_video(video, "output.mp4", fps=8)
```

Additionally, the models can be serialized and stored in a quantized datatype to save disk space when using PytorchAO.
