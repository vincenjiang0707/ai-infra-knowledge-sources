If you are using the weights from this repository, please update to

These weights are **not compatible** with older versions of the transformers library.

## Model Introduction

GLM-4-9B is the open-source version of the latest generation of pre-trained models in the GLM-4 series launched by Zhipu
AI. In the evaluation of data sets in semantics, mathematics, reasoning, code, and knowledge, **GLM-4-9B**
and its human preference-aligned version **GLM-4-9B-Chat** have shown superior performance beyond Llama-3-8B. In
addition to multi-round conversations, GLM-4-9B-Chat also has advanced features such as web browsing, code execution,
custom tool calls (Function Call), and long text
reasoning (supporting up to 128K context). This generation of models has added multi-language support, supporting 26
languages including Japanese, Korean, and German. We have also launched the **GLM-4-9B-Chat-1M** model that supports 1M
context length (about 2 million Chinese characters) and the multimodal model GLM-4V-9B based on GLM-4-9B.
**GLM-4V-9B** possesses dialogue capabilities in both Chinese and English at a high resolution of 1120*1120.
In various multimodal evaluations, including comprehensive abilities in Chinese and English, perception & reasoning,
text recognition, and chart understanding, GLM-4V-9B demonstrates superior performance compared to
GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09, Gemini 1.0 Pro, Qwen-VL-Max, and Claude 3 Opus.

We evaluated the GLM-4-9B base model on some typical tasks, and the results are as follows:

| Model               |   MMLU   |  C-Eval  |   GPQA   |  GSM8K   |   MATH   | HumanEval |
|:--------------------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|
| Llama-3-8B          |   66.6   |   51.2   |    -     |   45.8   |    -     |     -     | 
| Llama-3-8B-Instruct |   68.4   |   51.3   |   34.2   |   79.6   |   30.0   |   62.2    |
| ChatGLM3-6B-Base    |   61.4   |   69.0   |    -     |   72.3   |   25.7   |     -     |
| GLM-4-9B            | **74.7** | **77.1** | **34.3** | **84.0** | **30.4** | **70.1**  |

**This repository is the base version of GLM-4-9B, supporting 8K context length.**


## Quick Start

**For more inference code and requirements, please visit our [github page](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4).**

**Please strictly follow the [dependencies](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4/blob/main/basic_demo/requirements.txt) to
install, otherwise it will not run properly**

### Transformers Lib(4.46.0 and later version) for inference:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import os

os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0' # Set the GPU number. If a single machine has a single card, specify one. If a single machine has multiple cards, specify multiple GPU numbers.

MODEL_PATH = "THUDM/glm-4-9b-hf"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    MODEL_PATH,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    low_cpu_mem_usage=True,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    device_map="auto"
).eval()
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH, trust_remote_code=True)

encoding = tokenizer("what is your name?<|endoftext|>")
inputs = {key: torch.tensor([value]).to(device) for key, value in encoding.items()}

gen_kwargs = {"max_length": 2500, "do_sample": True, "top_k": 1}
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs, **gen_kwargs)
    outputs = outputs[:, inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]:]
    print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
