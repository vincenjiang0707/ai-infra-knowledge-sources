We release **Qwen3-TTS**, a series of powerful speech generation models developed by Qwen, offering comprehensive support for voice cloning, voice design, ultra-high-quality human-like speech generation, and natural language-based voice control.

## Overview
Qwen3-TTS covers 10 major languages (Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian) as well as multiple dialectal voice profiles. Key features:

* **Powerful Speech Representation**: Powered by the self-developed Qwen3-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz, it achieves efficient acoustic compression and high-dimensional semantic modeling.
* **Universal End-to-End Architecture**: Utilizing a discrete multi-codebook LM architecture to bypass traditional information bottlenecks.
* **Extreme Low-Latency Streaming Generation**: Supports streaming generation with end-to-end synthesis latency as low as 97ms.
* **Intelligent Voice Control**: Supports speech generation driven by natural language instructions for flexible control over timbre, emotion, and prosody.

## Quickstart

### Environment Setup

Install the `qwen-tts` Python package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install -U qwen-tts
```

### Python Package Usage

```python
import torch
import soundfile as sf
from qwen_tts import Qwen3TTSModel

# Load the model
model = Qwen3TTSModel.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice",
    device_map="cuda:0",
    dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)

# Custom Voice Generation
wavs, sr = model.generate_custom_voice(
    text="其实我真的有发现，我是一个特别善于观察别人情绪的人。",
    language="Chinese",
    speaker="Vivian",
    instruct="用特别愤怒的语气说",
)
sf.write("output.wav", wavs[0], sr)
```

## Evaluation

Zero-shot speech generation on the Seed-TTS test set (Word Error Rate (WER, ↓)):

| Model | test-zh | test-en |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base | 0.77 | 1.24 |
