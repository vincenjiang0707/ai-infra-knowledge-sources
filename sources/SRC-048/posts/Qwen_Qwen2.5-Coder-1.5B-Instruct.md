## Introduction

Qwen2.5-Coder is the latest series of Code-Specific Qwen large language models (formerly known as CodeQwen). As of now, Qwen2.5-Coder has covered six mainstream model sizes, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 7, 14, 32 billion parameters, to meet the needs of different developers. Qwen2.5-Coder brings the following improvements upon CodeQwen1.5:

- Significantly improvements in **code generation**, **code reasoning** and **code fixing**. Base on the strong Qwen2.5, we scale up the training tokens into 5.5 trillion including source code, text-code grounding, Synthetic data, etc. Qwen2.5-Coder-32B has become the current state-of-the-art open-source codeLLM, with its coding abilities matching those of GPT-4o.
- A more comprehensive foundation for real-world applications such as **Code Agents**. Not only enhancing coding capabilities but also maintaining its strengths in mathematics and general competencies.

**This repo contains the instruction-tuned 1.5B Qwen2.5-Coder model**, which has the following features:
- Type: Causal Language Models
- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training
- Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, Attention QKV bias and tied word embeddings
- Number of Parameters: 1.54B
- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 1.31B
- Number of Layers: 28
- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 12 for Q and 2 for KV
- Context Length: Full 32,768 tokens

## Requirements

The code of Qwen2.5-Coder has been in the latest Hugging face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.

With `transformers<4.37.0`, you will encounter the following error:
```
KeyError: 'qwen2'
```

## Quickstart

Here provides a code snippet with `apply_chat_template` to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

prompt = "write a quick sort algorithm."
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=512
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
```


## Evaluation & Performance

Detailed evaluation results are reported in this [📑 blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-coder-family/).

For requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results [here](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark/speed_benchmark.html).
