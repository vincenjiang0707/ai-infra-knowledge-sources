CombiBench is the first benchmark focused on combinatorial problems, based on the formal language Lean 4. CombiBench is a manually produced benchmark, including 100 combinatorial mathematics problems of varying difficulty and knowledge levels. It aims to provide a benchmark for evaluating the combinatorial mathematics capabilities of automated theorem proving systems to advance the field. For problems that require providing a solution first and then proving its correctness, we have referred to the style of [PutnamBench](https://github.com/trishullab/PutnamBench).

We are hosting a [**leaderboard**](https://moonshotai.github.io/CombiBench/leaderboard.html) and will readily receive evaluation results which are accompanied by a preprint or publication. Please reach out privately at `liujunqi@amss.ac.cn` with any requests for additions to the leaderboard. 

## Statistics 

We collected all combinatorics problems from the official IMO problems since 2000, except for one problem that relies on a figure. And We selected problems through random sampling from 14 chapters in the book, choosing 3 problems from each chapter, ensuring that the 42 problems are evenly distributed across all 14 chapters. We randomly selected 10 simple combinatorics problems at the middle school level from a mathematics problem collection website [hackmath](https://www.hackmath.net/). Then, we randomly collected 12 problems from other mathematics competitions.

Note : The complete proofs of Problem 3 and Problem 5 from IMO 2024 have already been formalized in [mathlib4/Archive/Imo2024Q3](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Archive/Imo/Imo2024Q3.html) and [mathlib4/Archive/Imo2024Q5](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Archive/Imo/Imo2024Q5.html). Therefore, we directly refer to the statements of these problems, along with the necessary definitions used in the statements. We are very grateful to Joseph Myers, the author of these two problems. We also appreciate his suggestions on the formalization of our problems.

## Requirements

This project requires `python >= 3.10`, `Lean>=4.15.0`.

Install the Python dependencies:

```
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
### Setup a Lean Server

Follow https://github.com/project-numina/kimina-lean-server to configure a lean server and get a custom url and API_KEY.

### Setup a LLM API Key

We support API interfaces such as OpenAI, Antropic, TogetherAI, and Google GenerativeAI.

### Configuration

Refer to `evaluation/config/template.json5` to configure the dataset, lean server, llm server, generation parameters, prompt, and parallel parameters.

### Run Evaluation

To run one-stage Fine-Eval:

```
python evaluation/cli.py online-one-stage -c evaluation/config/template.json5
```

To run two-stage Fine-Eval:

```
python evaluation/cli.py online-two-stage -c evaluation/config/template.json5
```

Note that both evaluation methods are compatible with theorem proving tasks and fill-in-the-blank tasks.

If you use `uv`, you can run the following command to quick evaluate with default settings:
```
uv run evaluation/cli.py online-two-stage -c evaluation/config/template.json5
```

More command line options can be found by running `python evaluation/cli.py <COMMAND> --help`.
