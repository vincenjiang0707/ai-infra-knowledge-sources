## Abstract

We introduce PerceptionBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the atomic visual perception capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Existing benchmarks often fail to isolate perception: holistic evaluations conflate perceptual errors with failures in reasoning or domain knowledge, while application-driven benchmarks only cover narrow, fragmented domains shaped by heuristic designs. To address these limitations, PerceptionBench adopts a bottom-up approach: by diagnosing the earliest failure points in the response of frontier MLLMs across 42 existing benchmarks, we construct an error taxonomy whose perception branch defines ten atomic perceptual capabilities. Guided by this taxonomy, we construct 3,000 verified questions with short, unambiguous answers, each isolating a single capability, with difficulty stemming from perception rather than reasoning or knowledge. Benchmark results across sixteen frontier MLLMs reveal that atomic perception remains largely unsolved—no model reaches 60% accuracy, perception-related hallucination is the weakest capability on average, and similar overall scores conceal sharply divergent capability profiles. PerceptionBench thus provides a capability-level standard for measuring and diagnosing the visual perception boundaries of MLLMs.

## Dataset Statistics

<img src="images/fig_distribution.png">

The released benchmark comprises **3,000 verified questions** across the **ten atomic perceptual capabilities**. By construction source, **1,800 (60%)** are atomic sub-questions decomposed from attributed failures on the source benchmarks, while the remaining **1,200 (40%)** are newly authored on supplemented images. The 3,000 questions are subsampled with capability-level balancing and difficulty stratification from the constructed portion of an in-house pool of **17,000+ verified samples**.

## Leaderboard

Sixteen frontier MLLMs (ten proprietary, six open-source) are evaluated with unified prompts and the highest available reasoning budget. All questions are open-ended with short, uniquely determined answers; **GPT-oss-120B** judges each response against the reference (agreement with human judgment: **99.7%** on a 300-sample audit). Scores are accuracy (%).

## Quick Start: Evaluate Your Model

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MoonshotAI/PerceptionBench.git
cd PerceptionBench
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in your credentials (auto-loaded via python-dotenv)
```

or export the variables directly:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://your-endpoint/v1"   # any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
```

### 3. Run

```bash
python eval/eval.py
```

All configuration is read from environment variables (or `.env`):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | required | API key for the OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | required | Base URL of the OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `MODEL` | required | Model under evaluation |
| `JUDGE_MODEL` | `gpt-oss-120b` | LLM judge for free-form answers (matches the paper) |
| `DATASET` | `PerceptionBench.jsonl` | Path to the benchmark JSONL file |
| `CONCURRENCY` | `16` | Concurrent requests |
| `MAX_TOKENS` | `65536` | Max generation tokens per question |
| `MAX_RETRIES` | `3` | API-call retries before giving up; `-1` = retry forever |
| `PRED_TEMPERATURE` | unset | Prediction sampling temperature (judge runs at 0.3) |
| `TOP_P` | unset | Nucleus sampling for predictions |
| `TOP_K` | unset | Top-k sampling for predictions (via `extra_body`) |

Per-item predictions are written to `results/PerceptionBench_<model>.jsonl` and overall/per-category accuracy to `results/PerceptionBench_<model>_scores.json`.

The evaluator feeds question + images to the model, then asks the judge to grade the free-form answer against the reference with the paper's teacher-grading prompt (`eval/judge_prompt.txt`), returning a strict 0/1 verdict per item.
