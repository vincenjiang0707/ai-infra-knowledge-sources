We introduce Kimi-Dev-72B, our new open-source coding LLM for software engineering tasks. Kimi-Dev-72B achieves a new state-of-the-art on SWE-bench Verified among open-source models.

- Kimi-Dev-72B achieves 60.4% performance on SWE-bench Verified. It surpasses the runner-up, setting a new state-of-the-art result among open-source models.


- Kimi-Dev-72B is optimized via large-scale reinforcement learning. It autonomously patches real repositories in Docker and gains rewards only when the entire test suite passes. This ensures correct and robust solutions, aligning with real-world development standards.


- Kimi-Dev-72B is available for download and deployment on Hugging Face and GitHub. We welcome developers and researchers to explore its capabilities and contribute to development.

<!-- ## 💡 Introduction -->

<!-- ## 🔥 News -->



## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Dev.git
# create env
conda create -n kimidev python=3.12
# local install
pip install -e .
```

## 🛠️ How to use

### Prepare repo structure [From [Agentless](https://github.com/OpenAutoCoder/Agentless/)]
Since for each issue in the benchmark (both SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified) we need to checkout the repository and process the files, you might want to save some time by downloading the preprocessed data here: [swebench_repo_structure.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15-4XjTmY48ystrsc_xcvtOkMs3Fx8RoW/view). After downloading, please unzip and export the location as such 
```bash
export PROJECT_FILE_LOC={folder which you saved}
``` 

### Deploy vLLM Model

#### Installation
```
# Install vLLM with CUDA 12.8.
# If you are using pip.
pip install vllm --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
# If you are using uv.
uv pip install vllm --torch-backend=auto
```

#### Serving
```
vllm serve Kimi-Dev-72B --served-model-name kimi-dev --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --gpu-memory-utilization 0.95 --max-seq-len-to-capture 131072 --tensor-parallel-size 8
```

### Rollout
Kimi-Dev adopts a simplified two-stage framework for handling code repair and test writing tasks:

1. **File Localization**: Intelligently identify key files that need modification based on problem descriptions and repository structure
2. **Code Editing**: Perform precise code modifications on the located files, including bug fixes or unit test insertions

Compared to multi-step localization methods, we perform localization at the file level and then pass the complete file to the repair step for more detailed reasoning.

Run rollout script:

```
conda activate kimidev
# Bugfixer
python kimidev/examples/rollout_messages_bugfixer.py --model_name {vllm_serve_model}
# Testwriter
python kimidev/examples/rollout_messages_testwriter.py --model_name {vllm_serve_model}
```

## 👀 Example Results
We provide some example result files as well as the files required for test-time scaling [here](./resources/).

You can also download these files from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tv4u9_CjCAOIhyZC1pOmpHFx3q0Ui8ru/view?usp=drive_link).
