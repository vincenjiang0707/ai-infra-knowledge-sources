### Featured projects

**TL;DR**

PyTorch Conference North America 2026 features Agentic AI and Next-Gen Intelligence across sessions on training agents, serving agents in production, agents that build PyTorch, and PyTorch in the physical world.

**Agentic AI and Next-gen Intelligence at PyTorch Con NA**

When you look at the schedule for PyTorch Conference North America 2026, one thing jumps out: agents are featured everywhere. They write kernels, triage CI, migrate workloads between chips, drive robots, and answer the phone. The interesting questions have shifted from whether a model can do any of these things to how we train, serve, govern, and debug systems that act on their own.

Here is a guided tour of the agentic AI and next-generation intelligence content across the two days of PyTorch Conference North America, along with why it is worth being in the room.

**It starts on the keynote stage**

Three keynotes frame the whole conversation.

**Beyond Brute Force: The Era of Adaptive Intelligence**

**Sara Hooker, Adaption**

*October 20, 09:40am | Grand Ballroom*

The next unlock isn’t scale, it’s architecture: systems that keep learning after deployment, closing the gap between a model’s frozen training distribution and the world it actually operates in. Sara’s talk digs into continual, gradient-free learning, which includes updating behavior without full retraining, without catastrophic forgetting, and without paying for repeated fine-tuning cycles. If you have ever shipped a model and watched it slowly drift out of relevance, you will not want to miss this.

**Workload Fungibility in the Age of Agents**

**Bill Jia, Google Cloud**

*October 21, 09:15am | Grand Ballroom*

The other half of the story addresses agents as developers. Alongside the deep dive on TorchTPU going open source, Jia demos long-horizon agentic workflows that migrate complex model workloads from GPUs to TPUs. The workflows keep going, hill-climbing on quantization, custom kernel generation, and sharding strategies with minimal human intervention.

**Agentic AI Foundation Keynote**

**Mazin Gilbert, Agentic AI Foundation**

*October 21, 09:10 | Grand Ballroom*

Mazin Gilbert is the Executive Director of the Agentic AI Foundation at the Linux Foundation and has over 25 years of experience pioneering open source platforms, authoring 100+ research papers, and holding 260+ U.S. patents. In his keynote, he will provide critical context on how agentic infrastructure is establishing a neutral governance home to support scalable, enterprise-ready open source AI deployment.

**Training agents: RL becomes a requirement **

The single densest cluster of agentic content is in post-training. Multi-turn, tool-using, long-horizon RL has moved from research curiosity to production requirement.

**Agentic RL Training in PyTorch**

*October 20, 17:30 | 210AE*

OpenEnv is the interoperability layer for publishing and running RL environments, co-owned by Hugging Face, Meta, Unsloth, Prime Intellect, Modal, NVIDIA, Mercor, and others. Frontier labs train models inside their own harness, while the open ecosystem vendors model, harness, and train separately. This talk is about closing that gap, and it ends with a demo you can fork on one GPU.

**Train the Agent, Not Just the Model**

**Sergio Paniego Blanco, Hugging Face**

*October 21, 12:20 | LL21DEF*

A sharp, specific lightning talk on training-inference mismatch: why small token-level numerical disagreements between the rollout engine and the training path are not benign, and how they can quietly reshape your PPO/GRPO objective.

**Serving agents in production**

Agentic workloads break the assumptions inference stacks were built on. Sessions may sit idle for hours before a follow-up arrives. Context is long, multi-turn, and tool-laden. CPU work such as orchestration, tool execution, and scheduling stops being a rounding error.
