##
1.1. NVIDIA Ampere GPU Architecture[](https://docs.nvidia.com#nvidia-ampere-gpu-architecture)

The NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture is NVIDIA’s latest architecture for CUDA compute applications. The NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture retains and extends the same CUDA programming model provided by previous NVIDIA GPU architectures such as Turing and Volta, and applications that follow the best practices for those architectures should typically see speedups on the NVIDIA A100 GPU without any code changes. This guide summarizes the ways that an application can be fine-tuned to gain additional speedups by leveraging the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture’s features.[1](https://docs.nvidia.com#fn1)

For further details on the programming features discussed in this guide, please refer to the [CUDA Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/index.html).

##
1.2. CUDA Best Practices[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-best-practices)

The performance guidelines and best practices described in the [CUDA Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/index.html) and the [CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/) apply to all CUDA-capable GPU architectures. Programmers must primarily focus on following those recommendations to achieve the best performance.

The high-priority recommendations from those guides are as follows:

Find ways to parallelize sequential code.

Minimize data transfers between the host and the device.

Adjust kernel launch configuration to maximize device utilization.

Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced.

Minimize redundant accesses to global memory whenever possible.

Avoid long sequences of diverged execution by threads within the same warp.


##
1.3. Application Compatibility[](https://docs.nvidia.com#application-compatibility)

Before addressing specific performance tuning issues covered in this guide, refer to the [NVIDIA Ampere GPU Architecture Compatibility Guide for CUDA Applications](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/ampere-compatibility-guide/) to ensure that your application is compiled in a way that is compatible with the NVIDIA Ampere GPU Architecture.

1.4. NVIDIA Ampere GPU Architecture Tuning[](https://docs.nvidia.com#nvidia-ampere-gpu-architecture-tuning)

###
1.4.1. Streaming Multiprocessor[](https://docs.nvidia.com#streaming-multiprocessor)

The NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture’s Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) provides the following improvements over Volta and Turing.

####
1.4.1.1. Occupancy[](https://docs.nvidia.com#occupancy)

The maximum number of concurrent warps per SM remains the same as in Volta (i.e., 64) for compute capability 8.0, while for compute capability 8.6 it is 48. Other [factors influencing warp occupancy](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/NsightCompute/index.html#occupancy-calculator) are:

The register file size is 64K 32-bit registers per SM.

The maximum number of registers per thread is 255.

The maximum number of thread blocks per SM is 32 for devices of compute capability 8.0 (i.e., A100 GPUs) and 16 for GPUs with compute capability 8.6.

For devices of compute capability 8.0 (i.e., A100 GPUs) shared memory capacity per SM is 164 KB, a 71% increase compared to V100’s capacity of 96 KB. For GPUs with compute capability 8.6, shared memory capacity per SM is 100 KB.

For devices of compute capability 8.0 (i.e., A100 GPUs) the maximum shared memory per thread block is 163 KB. For GPUs with compute capability 8.6 maximum shared memory per thread block is 99 KB.


Overall, developers can expect similar occupancy as on Volta without changes to their application.

####
1.4.1.3. Hardware Acceleration for Split Arrive/Wait Barrier[](https://docs.nvidia.com#hardware-acceleration-for-split-arrive-wait-barrier)

The NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture adds hardware acceleration for a split arrive/wait barrier in shared memory. These barriers can be used to implement fine grained thread controls, producer-consumer computation pipeline and divergence code patterns in CUDA. These barriers can also be used alongside the asynchronous copy. For more information on the Arrive/Wait Barriers refer to the Arrive/Wait Barrier section in the [CUDA Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/04-special-topics/async-barriers.html#asynchronous-barriers).

####
1.4.1.4. Warp level support for Reduction Operations[](https://docs.nvidia.com#warp-level-support-for-reduction-operations)

The NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture adds native support for warp wide reduction operations for 32-bit signed and unsigned integer operands. The warp wide reduction operations support arithmetic `add`

, `min`

, and `max`

operations on 32-bit signed and unsigned integers and bitwise `and`

, `or`

and `xor`

operations on 32-bit unsigned integers.

For more details on the new warp wide reduction operations refer to Warp Reduce Functions in the [CUDA Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/05-appendices/cpp-language-extensions.html#warp-reduce-functions).

####
1.4.1.5. Improved Tensor Core Operations[](https://docs.nvidia.com#improved-tensor-core-operations)

The NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture includes new Third Generation Tensor Cores that are more powerful than the Tensor Cores used in Volta and Turing SMs. The new Tensor Cores use a larger base matrix size and add powerful new math modes including:

Support for FP64 Tensor Core, using new DMMA instructions.

Support for Bfloat16 Tensor Core, through HMMA instructions. BFloat16 format is especially effective for DL training scenarios. Bfloat16 provides 8-bit exponent i.e., same range as FP32, 7-bit mantissa and 1 sign-bit.

Support for TF32 Tensor Core, through HMMA instructions. TF32 is a new 19-bit Tensor Core format that can be easily integrated into programs for more accurate DL training than 16-bit HMMA formats. TF32 provides 8-bit exponent, 10-bit mantissa and 1 sign-bit.

Support for bitwise

`AND`

along with bitwise`XOR`

which was introduced in Turing, through BMMA instructions.

The following table presents the evolution of matrix instruction sizes and supported data types for Tensor Cores across different GPU architecture generations.

####
1.4.1.6. Improved FP32 throughput[](https://docs.nvidia.com#improved-fp32-throughput)

Devices of compute capability 8.6 have 2x more FP32 operations per cycle per SM than devices of compute capability 8.0. While a binary compiled for 8.0 will run as is on 8.6, it is recommended to compile explicitly for 8.6 to benefit from the increased FP32 throughput.

###
1.4.2. Memory System[](https://docs.nvidia.com#memory-system)

####
1.4.2.1. Increased Memory Capacity and High Bandwidth Memory[](https://docs.nvidia.com#increased-memory-capacity-and-high-bandwidth-memory)

The NVIDIA A100 GPU increases the HBM2 memory capacity from 32 GB in V100 GPU to 40 GB in A100 GPU. Along with the increased memory capacity, the bandwidth is increased by 72%, from 900 GB/s on Volta V100 to 1550 GB/s on A100.

####
1.4.2.2. Increased L2 capacity and L2 Residency Controls[](https://docs.nvidia.com#increased-l2-capacity-and-l2-residency-controls)

The NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture increases the capacity of the L2 cache to 40 MB in Tesla A100, which is 7x larger than Tesla V100. Along with the increased capacity, the bandwidth of the L2 cache to the SMs is also increased. The NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture allows CUDA users to control the persistence of data in L2 cache. For more information on the persistence of data in L2 cache, refer to the section on managing L2 cache in the [CUDA Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/04-special-topics/l2-cache-control.html#l2-cache-control).

###
1.4.3. Third Generation NVLink[](https://docs.nvidia.com#third-generation-nvlink)

The third generation of NVIDIA’s high-speed NVLink interconnect is implemented in A100 GPUs, which significantly enhances multi-GPU scalability, performance, and reliability with more links per GPU, much faster communication bandwidth, and improved error-detection and recovery features. The third generation NVLink has the same bi-directional data rate of 50 GB/s per link, but uses half the number of signal pairs to achieve this bandwidth. Therefore, the total number of links available is increased to twelve in A100, versus six in V100, yielding 600 GB/s bidirectional bandwidth versus 300 GB/s for V100.

NVLink operates transparently within the existing CUDA model. Transfers between NVLink-connected endpoints are automatically routed through NVLink, rather than PCIe. The `cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess()`

API call remains necessary to enable direct transfers (over either PCIe or NVLink) between GPUs. The `cudaDeviceCanAccessPeer()`

can be used to determine if peer access is possible between any pair of GPUs.

In the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture remote NVLINK accesses go through a Link TLB on the remote GPU. This Link TLB has a reach of 64 GB to the remote GPU’s memory. Applications with remote random accesses may want to constrain the remotely accessed region to 64 GB for each peer GPU.
