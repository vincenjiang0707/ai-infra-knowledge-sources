cuSOLVER API Reference

The API reference guide for cuSOLVER, a GPU accelerated library for decompositions and linear system solutions for both dense and sparse matrices.

#
1. Introduction[](https://docs.nvidia.com#introduction)

The cuSolver library is a high-level package based on the cuBLAS and cuSPARSE libraries. It consists of two modules corresponding to two sets of API:

The cuSolver API on a single GPU

The cuSolverMG API on a single node multiGPU


Each of these can be used independently or in concert with other toolkit libraries. To simplify the notation, cuSolver denotes single GPU API and cuSolverMg denotes multiGPU API.

The intent of cuSolver is to provide useful LAPACK-like features, such as common matrix factorization and triangular solve routines for dense matrices, a sparse least-squares solver and an eigenvalue solver. In addition cuSolver provides a new refactorization library useful for solving sequences of matrices with a shared sparsity pattern.

cuSolver combines three separate components under a single umbrella. The first part of cuSolver is called cuSolverDN, and deals with dense matrix factorization and solve routines such as LU, QR, SVD and LDLT, as well as useful utilities such as matrix and vector permutations.

Next, cuSolverSP provides a new set of sparse routines based on a sparse QR factorization. Not all matrices have a good sparsity pattern for parallelism in factorization, so the cuSolverSP library also provides a CPU path to handle those sequential-like matrices. For those matrices with abundant parallelism, the GPU path will deliver higher performance. The library is designed to be called from C and C++.

The final part is cuSolverRF, a sparse re-factorization package that can provide very good performance when solving a sequence of matrices where only the coefficients are changed but the sparsity pattern remains the same.

The GPU path of the cuSolver library assumes data is already in the device memory. It is the responsibility of the developer to allocate memory and to copy data between GPU memory and CPU memory using standard CUDA runtime API routines, such as `cudaMalloc()`

, `cudaFree()`

, `cudaMemcpy()`

, and `cudaMemcpyAsync()`

.

cuSolverMg is GPU-accelerated ScaLAPACK. By now, cuSolverMg supports 1-D column block cyclic layout and provides symmetric eigenvalue solver.

Note

The cuSolver library requires hardware with a CUDA Compute Capability (CC) of 5.0 or higher. Please see the *CUDA Programming Guide* for a list of the [Compute Capabilities](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/05-appendices/compute-capabilities.html#compute-capabilities) corresponding to all NVIDIA GPUs.

Note

cuSolverMG is deprecated. Users are encouraged to use [cuSOLVERMp](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusolvermp/) for multi-GPU functionality, both single- and multi-node.

##
1.1. cuSolverDN: Dense LAPACK[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdn-dense-lapack)

The cuSolverDN library was designed to solve dense linear systems of the form

where the coefficient matrix \(A\in R^{nxn}\) , right-hand-side vector \(b\in R^{n}\) and solution vector \(x\in R^{n}\)

The cuSolverDN library provides QR factorization and LU with partial pivoting to handle a general matrix `A`

, which may be non-symmetric. Cholesky factorization is also provided for symmetric/Hermitian matrices. For symmetric indefinite matrices, we provide Bunch-Kaufman (LDL) factorization.

The cuSolverDN library also provides a helpful bidiagonalization routine and singular value decomposition (SVD).

The cuSolverDN library targets computationally-intensive and popular routines in LAPACK, and provides an API compatible with LAPACK. The user can accelerate these time-consuming routines with cuSolverDN and keep others in LAPACK without a major change to existing code.

##
1.2. cuSolverSP: Sparse LAPACK[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolversp-sparse-lapack)

The cuSolverSP library was mainly designed to a solve sparse linear system

and the least-squares problem

where sparse matrix \(A\in R^{mxn}\) , right-hand-side vector \(b\in R^{m}\) and solution vector \(x\in R^{n}\) . For a linear system, we require `m=n`

.

The core algorithm is based on sparse QR factorization. The matrix `A`

is accepted in CSR format. If matrix `A`

is symmetric/Hermitian, the user has to provide a full matrix, ie fill missing lower or upper part.

If matrix `A`

is symmetric positive definite and the user only needs to solve \(Ax = b\) , Cholesky factorization can work and the user only needs to provide the lower triangular part of `A`

.

On top of the linear and least-squares solvers, the `cuSolverSP`

library provides a simple eigenvalue solver based on shift-inverse power method, and a function to count the number of eigenvalues contained in a box in the complex plane.

Note

cuSolverSp is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. It is recommended migrating to a new sparse direct solver package, [cuDSS](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudss), and you can find a transition example in [CUDALibrarySamples/cuSOLVERSp2cuDSS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/CUDALibrarySamples/tree/main/cuSOLVERSp2cuDSS) for reference.

##
1.3. cuSolverRF: Refactorization[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverrf-refactorization)

The cuSolverRF library was designed to accelerate solution of sets of linear systems by fast re-factorization when given new coefficients in the same sparsity pattern

where a sequence of coefficient matrices \(A_{i}\in R^{nxn}\) , right-hand-sides \(f_{i}\in R^{n}\) and solutions \(x_{i}\in R^{n}\) are given for `i=1,...,k`

.

The cuSolverRF library is applicable when the sparsity pattern of the coefficient matrices \(A_{i}\) as well as the reordering to minimize fill-in and the pivoting used during the LU factorization remain the same across these linear systems. In that case, the first linear system (`i=1`

) requires a full LU factorization, while the subsequent linear systems (`i=2,...,k`

) require only the LU re-factorization. The later can be performed using the cuSolverRF library.

Notice that because the sparsity pattern of the coefficient matrices, the reordering and pivoting remain the same, the sparsity pattern of the resulting triangular factors \(L_{i}\) and \(U_{i}\) also remains the same. Therefore, the real difference between the full LU factorization and LU re-factorization is that the required memory is known ahead of time.

Note

cuSolverRf is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. It is recommended migrating to a new sparse direct solver package, [cuDSS](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudss), and you can find a transition example in [CUDALibrarySamples/cuSOLVERSp2cuDSS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/CUDALibrarySamples/tree/main/cuSOLVERSp2cuDSS) for reference.

##
1.4. Naming Conventions[](https://docs.nvidia.com#naming-conventions)

The cuSolverDN library provides two different APIs; `legacy`

and `generic`

.

The functions in the legacy API are available for data types `float`

, `double`

, `cuComplex`

, and `cuDoubleComplex`

. The naming convention for the legacy API is as follows:

|

where <`t`

> can be `S`

, `D`

, `C`

, `Z`

, or `X`

, corresponding to the data types `float`

, `double`

, `cuComplex`

, `cuDoubleComplex`

, and the generic type, respectively. <`operation`

> can be Cholesky factorization (`potrf`

), LU with partial pivoting (`getrf`

), QR factorization (`geqrf`

) and Bunch-Kaufman factorization (`sytrf`

).

The functions in the generic API provide a single entry point for each routine and support for 64-bit integers to define matrix and vector dimensions. The naming convention for the generic API is data-agnostic and is as follows:

|

where <`operation`

> can be Cholesky factorization (`potrf`

), LU with partial pivoting (`getrf`

) and QR factorization (`geqrf`

).

The cuSolverSP library functions are available for data types `float`

, `double`

, `cuComplex`

, and `cuDoubleComplex`

. The naming convention is as follows:

|

where `cuSolverSp`

is the GPU path and `cusolverSpHost`

is the corresponding CPU path. <`t`

> can be `S`

, `D`

, `C`

, `Z`

, or `X`

, corresponding to the data types `float`

, `double`

, `cuComplex`

, `cuDoubleComplex`

, and the generic type, respectively.

The <`matrix data format`

> is `csr`

, compressed sparse row format.

The <`operation`

> can be `ls`

, `lsq`

, `eig`

, `eigs`

, corresponding to linear solver, least-square solver, eigenvalue solver and number of eigenvalues in a box, respectively.

The <`output matrix data format`

> can be `v`

or `m`

, corresponding to a vector or a matrix.

<`based on`

> describes which algorithm is used. For example, `qr`

(sparse QR factorization) is used in linear solver and least-square solver.

All of the functions have the return type `cusolverStatus_t`

and are explained in more detail in the chapters that follow.

The cuSolverRF library routines are available for data type `double`

. Most of the routines follow the naming convention:

|

where the trailing optional Host qualifier indicates the data is accessed on the host versus on the device, which is the default. The <`operation`

> can be `Setup`

, `Analyze`

, `Refactor`

, `Solve`

, `ResetValues`

, `AccessBundledFactors`

and `ExtractSplitFactors`

.

Finally, the return type of the cuSolverRF library routines is `cusolverStatus_t`

.

##
1.5. Asynchronous Execution[](https://docs.nvidia.com#asynchronous-execution)

The cuSolver library functions prefer to keep asynchronous execution as much as possible. Developers can always use the `cudaDeviceSynchronize()`

function to ensure that the execution of a particular cuSolver library routine has completed.

A developer can also use the `cudaMemcpy()`

routine to copy data from the device to the host and vice versa, using the `cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost`

and `cudaMemcpyHostToDevice`

parameters, respectively. In this case there is no need to add a call to `cudaDeviceSynchronize()`

because the call to `cudaMemcpy()`

with the above parameters is blocking and completes only when the results are ready on the host.

##
1.6. Library Property[](https://docs.nvidia.com#library-property)

The `libraryPropertyType`

data type is an enumeration of library property types (that is, CUDA version X.Y.Z would yield `MAJOR_VERSION=X`

, `MINOR_VERSION=Y`

, `PATCH_LEVEL=Z`

).

```
typedef enum libraryPropertyType_t
{
MAJOR_VERSION,
MINOR_VERSION,
PATCH_LEVEL
} libraryPropertyType;
```

The following code can show the version of cusolver library.

```
int major=-1,minor=-1,patch=-1;
cusolverGetProperty(MAJOR_VERSION, &major);
cusolverGetProperty(MINOR_VERSION, &minor);
cusolverGetProperty(PATCH_LEVEL, &patch);
printf("CUSOLVER Version (Major,Minor,PatchLevel): %d.%d.%d\n", major,minor,patch);
```

##
1.7. High Precision Package[](https://docs.nvidia.com#high-precision-package)

The `cusolver`

library uses high precision for iterative refinement when necessary.

#
2. Using the CUSOLVER API[](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-the-cusolver-api)

##
2.1. General Description[](https://docs.nvidia.com#general-description)

This chapter describes how to use the cuSolver library API. It is not a reference for the cuSolver API data types and functions; that is provided in subsequent chapters.

###
2.1.1. Thread Safety[](https://docs.nvidia.com#thread-safety)

*The library is thread-safe, and its functions can be called from multiple host threads.*

###
2.1.2. Scalar Parameters[](https://docs.nvidia.com#scalar-parameters)

In the cuSolver API, the scalar parameters can be passed by reference on the host.

###
2.1.3. Parallelism with Streams[](https://docs.nvidia.com#parallelism-with-streams)

If the application performs several small independent computations, or if it makes data transfers in parallel with the computation, then CUDA streams can be used to overlap these tasks.

The application can conceptually associate a stream with each task. To achieve the overlap of computation between the tasks, the developer should:

Create CUDA streams using the function

`cudaStreamCreate()`

, andSet the stream to be used by each individual cuSolver library routine by calling, for example,

[cusolverDnSetStream()](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdnsetstream), just prior to calling the actual cuSolverDN routine.

The computations performed in separate streams would then be overlapped automatically on the GPU, when possible. This approach is especially useful when the computation performed by a single task is relatively small, and is not enough to fill the GPU with work, or when there is a data transfer that can be performed in parallel with the computation.

###
2.1.4. How to Link cusolver Library[](https://docs.nvidia.com#how-to-link-cusolver-library)

`cusolver`

library provides dynamic library `libcusolver.so`

and static library `libcusolver_static.a`

. If the user links the application with `libcusolver.so`

, `libcublas.so`

, `libcublasLt.so`

and `libcusparse.so`

are also required. If the user links the application with `libcusolver_static.a`

, the following libraries are also needed, `libcudart_static.a`

, `libculibos.a`

, `libcusolver_lapack_static.a`

, `libcusolver_metis_static.a`

, `libcublas_static.a`

and `libcusparse_static.a`

.

###
2.1.5. Link Third-party LAPACK Library[](https://docs.nvidia.com#link-third-party-lapack-library)

Starting with CUDA 10.1 update 2, NVIDIA LAPACK library `libcusolver_lapack_static.a`

is a subset of LAPACK and only contains GPU accelerated `stedc`

and `bdsqr`

. The user has to link `libcusolver_static.a`

with `libcusolver_lapack_static.a`

in order to build the application successfully. Prior to CUDA 10.1 update 2, the user can replace `libcusolver_lapack_static.a`

with a third-party LAPACK library, for example, MKL. In CUDA 10.1 update 2, the third-party LAPACK library no longer affects the behavior of cusolver library, neither functionality nor performance. Furthermore the user cannot use `libcusolver_lapack_static.a`

as a standalone LAPACK library because it is only a subset of LAPACK.

If you use

`libcusolver_static.a`

, then you must link with`libcusolver_lapack_static.a`

explicitly, otherwise the linker will report missing symbols. There are no symbol conflicts between`libcusolver_lapack_static.a`

and other third-party LAPACK libraries, which allows linking the same application to`libcusolver_lapack_static.a`

and another third-party LAPACK library.The

`libcusolver_lapack_static.a`

is built inside`libcusolver.so`

. Hence, if you use`libcusolver.so`

, then you don’t need to specify a LAPACK library. The`libcusolver.so`

will not pick up any routines from the third-party LAPACK library even if you link the application with it.

###
2.1.6. Convention of info[](https://docs.nvidia.com#convention-of-info)

Each LAPACK routine returns an `info`

which indicates the position of invalid parameter. If `info = -i`

, then i-th parameter is invalid. To be consistent with base-1 in LAPACK, `cusolver`

does not report invalid `handle`

into `info`

. Instead, `cusolver`

returns `CUSOLVER_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED`

for invalid `handle`

.

###
2.1.7. Usage of _bufferSize[](https://docs.nvidia.com#usage-of-buffersize)

There is no cudaMalloc inside `cuSolver`

library, the user must allocate the device workspace explicitly. The routine `xyz_bufferSize`

is to query the size of workspace of the routine `xyz`

, for example `xyz = potrf`

. To make the API simple, `xyz_bufferSize`

follows almost the same signature of `xyz`

even it only depends on some parameters, for example, device pointer is not used to decide the size of workspace. In most cases, `xyz_bufferSize`

is called in the beginning before actual device data (pointed to by a device pointer) is prepared or before the device pointer is allocated. In such case, the user can pass null pointer to `xyz_bufferSize`

without breaking the functionality.

###
2.1.8. cuSOLVERDn Logging[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdn-logging)

cuSOLVERDn logging mechanism can be enabled by setting the following environment variables before launching the target application:

-
`CUSOLVERDN_LOG_LEVEL=<level>`

- where`<level>`

is one of the following levels:`0`

- Off - logging is disabled (default)`1`

- Error - only errors will be logged`2`

- Trace - API calls that launch CUDA kernels will log their parameters and important information`3`

- Hints - hints that can potentially improve the application’s performance`4`

- Info - provides general information about the library execution, may contain details about heuristic status`5`

- API Trace - API calls will log their parameter and important information

-
`CUSOLVERDN_LOG_MASK=<mask>`

- where mask is a combination of the following masks:`0`

- Off`1`

- Error`2`

- Trace`4`

- Hints`8`

- Info`16`

- API Trace

`CUSOLVERDN_LOG_FILE=<file_name>`

- where file name is a path to a log file. File name may contain`%i`

, that will be replaced with the process ID, for example`<file_name>_%i.log`

. If`CUSOLVERDN_LOG_FILE`

is not defined, the log messages are printed to stdout.

Another option is to use the experimental cusolverDn logging API. See:
[cusolverDnLoggerSetCallback()](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdnloggersetcallback), [cusolverDnLoggerSetFile()](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdnloggersetfile), [cusolverDnLoggerOpenFile()](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdnloggeropenfile), [cusolverDnLoggerSetLevel()](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdnloggersetlevel), [cusolverDnLoggerSetMask()](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdnloggersetmask), [cusolverDnLoggerForceDisable()](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdnloggerforcedisable).

###
2.1.9. Deterministic Results[](https://docs.nvidia.com#deterministic-results)

Throughout this documentation, a function is declared as *deterministic* if it computes the exact same bitwise results for every execution with the same input parameters, hard- and software environment. Conversely, a *non-deterministic* function might compute bitwise different results due to a varying order of floating point operations, e.g., a sum `s`

of four values `a`

, `b`

, `c`

, `d`

can be computed in different orders:

`s = (a + b) + (c + d)`

`s = (a + (b + c)) + d`

`s = a + (b + (c + d))`

…


Due to the non-associativity of floating point arithmetic, all results might be bitwise different.

By default, cuSolverDN computes deterministic results. For improved performance of some functions, it is possible to allow non-deterministic results with `cusolverDnSetDeterministicMode()`

.

###
2.1.10. Floating Point Emulation[](https://docs.nvidia.com#floating-point-emulation)

cuSOLVERDn leverages techniques for floating point emulation as described in [cuBLAS 1.5 Floating Point Emulation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublas/#floating-point-emulation) for improved performance. Please note that all `cusolverDn{Get,Set}{FixedPoint}Emulation*`

APIs only affect execution, if a math mode, which allows floating point emulated math, is enabled. However, the corresponding configuration options, which affect floating point emulated math, can be set, regardless of the current math mode. Example:

```
cusolverDnSetMathMode(handle, CUSOLVER_DEFAULT_MATH);
cusolverDnSetEmulationStrategy(handle, EMULATION_STRATEGY_EAGER);
cusolverDnXgetrf(handle, ...); // default math
cusolverDnSetMathMode(handle, CUSOLVER_FP32_EMULATED_BF16X9_MATH);
cusolverDnXgetrf(handle, ...); // FP32 emulated math with eager emulation strategy
```

Note

Please note that cuBLAS environment variables, enabling floating point emulated math, won’t affect the cuSOLVERDn internal cuBLAS handles.

Note

Please note that the workspace sizes returned by `*_bufferSize`

APIs may depend on the math mode and emulation strategy.

##
2.2. cuSolver Types Reference[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolver-types-reference)

###
2.2.1. cuSolverDN Types[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdn-types)

The `float`

, `double`

, `cuComplex`

, and `cuDoubleComplex`

data types are supported. The first two are standard C data types, while the last two are exported from `cuComplex.h`

. In addition, cuSolverDN uses some familiar types from cuBLAS.

####
2.2.1.1. cusolverDnHandle_t[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdnhandle-t)

This is a pointer type to an opaque cuSolverDN context, which the user must initialize by calling [cusolverDnCreate()](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdncreate) prior to calling any other library function. An uninitialized Handle object will lead to unexpected behavior, including crashes of cuSolverDN. The handle created and returned by [cusolverDnCreate()](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdncreate) must be passed to every cuSolverDN function.

####
2.2.1.2. cublasFillMode_t[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cublasfillmode-t)

The type indicates which part (lower or upper) of the dense matrix was filled and consequently should be used by the function.

|
|
|---|---|
|
The lower part of the matrix is filled. |
|
The upper part of the matrix is filled. |
|
The full matrix is filled. |

Notice that BLAS implementations often use Fortran characters `‘L’`

or `‘l’`

(lower) and `‘U’`

or `‘u’`

(upper) to describe which part of the matrix is filled.

####
2.2.1.3. cublasOperation_t[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cublasoperation-t)

The `cublasOperation_t`

type indicates which operation needs to be performed with the dense matrix.

|
|
|---|---|
|
The non-transpose operation is selected. |
|
The transpose operation is selected. |
|
The conjugate transpose operation is selected. |

Notice that BLAS implementations often use Fortran characters `‘N’`

or `‘n’`

(non-transpose), `‘T’`

or `‘t’`

(transpose) and `‘C’`

or `‘c’`

(conjugate transpose) to describe which operations need to be performed with the dense matrix.

####
2.2.1.4. cusolverEigType_t[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolvereigtype-t)

The `cusolverEigType_t`

type indicates which type of eigenvalue the solver is.

|
|
|---|---|
|
A*x = lambda*B*x |
|
A*B*x = lambda*x |
|
B*A*x = lambda*x |

Notice that LAPACK implementations often use Fortran integer `1`

(A*x = lambda*B*x), `2`

(A*B*x = lambda*x), `3`

(B*A*x = lambda*x) to indicate which type of eigenvalue the solver is.

####
2.2.1.5. cusolverEigMode_t[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolvereigmode-t)

The `cusolverEigMode_t`

type indicates whether or not eigenvectors are computed.

|
|
|---|---|
|
Only eigenvalues are computed. |
|
Both eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed. |

Notice that LAPACK implementations often use Fortran character `'N'`

(only eigenvalues are computed), `'V'`

(both eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed) to indicate whether or not eigenvectors are computed.

####
2.2.1.6. cusolverEigComp_t[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolvereigcomp-t)

The `cusolverEigComp_t`

type indicates the computational mode for eigen routines that compute eigenvalues and optionally eigenvectors, analogous to the `compz`

argument in LAPACK.

|
|
|---|---|
|
Only eigenvalues are computed. |
|
The unitary matrix is initialized to the identity matrix. |
|
The product of the matrix given on entry with the orthogonal transformations accumulated during the computational routine is returned. |

The values of `cusolverEigComp_t`

correspond directly to the LAPACK `compz`

argument. In LAPACK, `compz`

is specified as a single character: `'N'`

means no eigenvectors are computed (eigenvalues only); `'I'`

means the eigenvector matrix is initialized to the identity and then updated by the routine; `'V'`

means the routine uses the matrix provided on entry and overwrites it with the product of that matrix and the orthogonal (or unitary) transformations accumulated during the computation. The cuSolver enumerants `CUSOLVER_EIG_COMP_N`

, `CUSOLVER_EIG_COMP_I`

, and `CUSOLVER_EIG_COMP_V`

map to LAPACK `'N'`

, `'I'`

, and `'V'`

respectively.

####
2.2.1.7. cusolverIRSRefinement_t[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverirsrefinement-t)

The `cusolverIRSRefinement_t`

type indicates which solver type would be used for the specific cusolver function. Most of our experimentation shows that CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_GMRES is the best option.

*More details about the refinement process can be found in Azzam Haidar, Stanimire Tomov, Jack Dongarra, and Nicholas J. Higham. 2018. Harnessing GPU tensor cores for fast FP16 arithmetic to speed up mixed-precision iterative refinement solvers. In Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC ‘18). IEEE Press, Piscataway, NJ, USA, Article 47, 11 pages.*

`CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_NOT_SET`

-
Solver is not set; this value is what is set when creating the

`params`

structure. IRS solver will return an error. `CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_NONE`

-
No refinement solver, the IRS solver performs a factorization followed by a solve without any refinement. For example if the IRS solver was

`cusolverDnIRSXgesv()`

, this is equivalent to a Xgesv routine without refinement and where the factorization is carried out in the lowest precision. If for example the main precision was CUSOLVER_R_64F and the lowest was CUSOLVER_R_64F as well, then this is equivalent to a call to`cusolverDnDgesv()`

. `CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_CLASSICAL`

-
Classical iterative refinement solver. Similar to the one used in LAPACK routines.

`CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_GMRES`

-
GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual) based iterative refinement solver. In recent study, the GMRES method has drawn the scientific community attention for its ability to be used as refinement solver that outperforms the classical iterative refinement method. Based on our experimentation, we recommend this setting.

`CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_CLASSICAL_GMRES`

-
Classical iterative refinement solver that uses the GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual) internally to solve the correction equation at each iteration. We call the

*classical refinement iteration*the outer iteration while the*GMRES*is called inner iteration. Note that if the tolerance of the inner GMRES is set very low, lets say to machine precision, then the outer*classical refinement iteration*will performs only one iteration and thus this option will behave like`CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_GMRES`

. `CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_GMRES_GMRES`

-
Similar to

`CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_CLASSICAL_GMRES`

which consists of classical refinement process that uses GMRES to solve the inner correction system; here it is a GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual) based iterative refinement solver that uses another GMRES internally to solve the preconditioned system.

####
2.2.1.8. cusolverDnIRSParams_t[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdnirsparams-t)

This is a pointer type to an opaque `cusolverDnIRSParams_t`

structure, which holds parameters for the iterative refinement linear solvers such as `cusolverDnXgesv()`

. Use corresponding helper functions described below to either Create/Destroy this structure or Set/Get solver parameters.

####
2.2.1.9. cusolverDnIRSInfos_t[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdnirsinfos-t)

This is a pointer type to an opaque `cusolverDnIRSInfos_t`

structure, which holds information about the performed call to an iterative refinement linear solver (such as `cusolverDnXgesv()`

). Use corresponding helper functions described below to either Create/Destroy this structure or retrieve solve information.

####
2.2.1.10. cusolverDnFunction_t[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdnfunction-t)

The `cusolverDnFunction_t`

type indicates which routine needs to be configured by `cusolverDnSetAdvOptions()`

. The value `CUSOLVERDN_GETRF`

corresponds to the routine `Getrf`

.

|
|
|---|---|
|
Corresponds to |

####
2.2.1.11. cusolverAlgMode_t[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolveralgmode-t)

The `cusolverAlgMode_t`

type indicates which algorithm is selected by `cusolverDnSetAdvOptions()`

. The set of algorithms supported for each routine is described in detail along with the routine’s documentation.

The default algorithm is `CUSOLVER_ALG_0`

. The user can also provide `NULL`

to use the default algorithm.

cusolverStatus_t
cusolverDnIRSParamsSetSolverPrecisions(
cusolverDnIRSParams_t params,
cusolverPrecType_t solver_main_precision,
cusolverPrecType_t solver_lowest_precision );
```

This function sets both the main and the lowest precision for the Iterative Refinement Solver (IRS). By main precision, we mean the precision of the Input and Output datatype. By lowest precision, we mean the solver is allowed to use as lowest computational precision during the LU factorization process. Note that the user has to set both the main and lowest precision before the first call to the IRS solver because they are NOT set by default with the `params`

structure creation, as it depends on the Input Output data type and user request. It is a wrapper to both `cusolverDnIRSParamsSetSolverMainPrecision()`

and `cusolverDnIRSParamsSetSolverLowestPrecision()`

. All possible combinations of main/lowest precision are described in the table below. Usually the lowest precision defines the speedup that can be achieved. The ratio of the performance of the lowest precision over the main precision (e.g., Inputs/Outputs datatype) define the upper bound of the speedup that could be obtained. More precisely, it depends on many factors, but for large matrices sizes, it is the ratio of the matrix-matrix rank-k product (e.g., GEMM where K is 256 and M=N=size of the matrix) that define the possible speedup. For instance, if the inout precision is real double precision CUSOLVER_R_64F and the lowest precision is CUSOLVER_R_32F, then we can expect a speedup of at most 2X for large problem sizes. If the lowest precision was CUSOLVER_R_16F, then we can expect 3X-4X. A reasonable strategy should take the number of right-hand sides, the size of the matrix as well as the convergence rate into account.

Note that the user has to set both the main and lowest precision before a first call to the IRS solver because they are NOT set by default with the `params`

structure creation, as it depends on the Input Output data type and user request. Usually the lowest precision defines the speedup that can be achieved. The ratio of the performance of the lowest precision over the main precision (e.g., Inputs/Outputs datatype) define somehow the upper bound of the speedup that could be obtained. More precisely, it depends on many factors, but for large matrices sizes, it is the ratio of the matrix-matrix rank-k product (e.g., GEMM where K is 256 and M=N=size of the matrix) that define the possible speedup. For instance, if the inout precision is real double precision CUSOLVER_R_64F and the lowest precision is CUSOLVER_R_32F, then we can expect a speedup of at most 2X for large problem sizes. If the lowest precision was CUSOLVER_R_16F, then we can expect 3X-4X. A reasonable strategy should take the number of right-hand sides, the size of the matrix as well as the convergence rate into account.

No refinement solver; the IRS solver performs a factorization followed by a solve without any refinement. For example, if the IRS solver was

`cusolverDnIRSXgesv()`

, this is equivalent to a Xgesv routine without refinement and where the factorization is carried out in the lowest precision. If for example the main precision was CUSOLVER_R_64F and the lowest was CUSOLVER_R_64F as well, then this is equivalent to a call to`cusolverDnDgesv()`

`CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_GMRES`

GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual) based iterative refinement solver. In recent study, the GMRES method has drawn the scientific community attention for its ability to be used as refinement solver that outperforms the classical iterative refinement method. Based on our experimentation, we recommend this setting.

`CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_CLASSICAL_GMRES`

-
Classical iterative refinement solver that uses the GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual) internally to solve the correction equation at each iteration. We call the

*classical refinement iteration*the outer iteration while the*GMRES*is called inner iteration. Note that if the tolerance of the inner GMRES is set very low, let say to machine precision, then the outer*classical refinement iteration*will performs only one iteration and thus this option will behaves like`CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_GMRES`

. `CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_GMRES_GMRES`

-
Similar to

`CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_CLASSICAL_GMRES`

which consists of classical refinement process that uses GMRES to solve the inner correction system, here it is a GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual) based iterative refinement solver that uses another GMRES internally to solve the preconditioned system.

```
cusolverStatus_t
cusolverDnIRSParamsSetTol(

```

This function sets the tolerance for the refinement solver. By default it is such that all the RHS satisfy:

`RNRM < SQRT(N)*XNRM*ANRM*EPS*BWDMAX`

where

RNRM is the infinity-norm of the residual

XNRM is the infinity-norm of the solution

ANRM is the infinity-operator-norm of the matrix A

EPS is the machine epsilon for the Inputs/Outputs datatype that matches LAPACK <X>LAMCH(‘Epsilon’)

BWDMAX, the value BWDMAX is fixed to 1.0


The user can use this function to change the tolerance to a lower or higher value. Our goal is to give the user more control such a way he can investigate and control every detail of the IRS solver. Note that the tolerance value is always in *real double precision* whatever the Inputs/Outputs datatype is.

This function sets the tolerance for the inner refinement solver when the refinement solver consists of two-levels solver (for example, CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_CLASSICAL_GMRES or CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_GMRES_GMRES cases). It is not referenced in case of one level refinement solver such as CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_CLASSICAL or CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_GMRES. It is set to 1e-4 by default. This function set the tolerance for the inner solver (e.g. the inner GMRES). For example, if the Refinement Solver was set to CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_CLASSICAL_GMRES, setting this tolerance mean that the inner GMRES solver will converge to that tolerance at each outer iteration of the classical refinement solver. Our goal is to give the user more control such a way he can investigate and control every detail of the IRS solver. Note the, the tolerance value is always in *real double precision* whatever the Inputs/Outputs datatype is.

This function sets the maximal number of iterations allowed for the inner refinement solver. It is not referenced in case of one level refinement solver such as CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_CLASSICAL or CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_GMRES. The inner refinement solver will stop after reaching either the inner tolerance or the MaxItersInner value. By default, it is set to 50. Note that this value could not be larger than the MaxIters since MaxIters is the total number of allowed iterations. Note that if the user calls `cusolverDnIRSParamsSetMaxIters`

```

This function enable the fallback to the main precision in case the Iterative Refinement Solver (IRS) failed to converge. In other term, if the IRS solver failed to converge, the solver will return a no convergence code (e.g., `niter`

< 0), but can either return the non-convergent solution as it is (e.g., disable fallback) or can fallback (e.g., enable fallback) to the main precision (which is the precision of the Inputs/Outputs data) and solve the problem from scratch returning the good solution. This is the behavior by default, and it will guarantee that the IRS solver always provide the good solution. This function is provided because we provided `cusolverDnIRSParamsDisableFallback`

which allows the user to disable the fallback and thus this function allow the user to re-enable it.

This function disables the fallback to the main precision in case the Iterative Refinement Solver (IRS) failed to converge. In other term, if the IRS solver failed to converge, the solver will return a no convergence code (e.g., `niter`

< 0), but can either return the non-convergent solution as it is (e.g., disable fallback) or can fallback (e.g., enable fallback) to the main precision (which is the precision of the Inputs/Outputs data) and solve the problem from scratch returning the good solution. This function disables the fallback and the returned solution is whatever the refinement solver was able to reach before it returns. Disabling fallback does not guarantee that the solution is the good one. However, if users want to keep getting the solution of the lower precision in case the IRS did not converge after certain number of iterations, they need to disable the fallback. The user can re-enable it by calling `cusolverDnIRSParamsEnableFallback`

cusolverStatus_t
cusolverDnIRSInfosGetResidualHistory(

void **residual_history );
```

If the user called `cusolverDnIRSInfosRequestResidual()`

before the call to the IRS function, then the IRS solver will store the convergence history (residual norms) of the refinement phase in a matrix that can be accessed via a pointer returned by this function. The datatype of the residual norms depends on the input and output data type. If the Inputs/Outputs datatype is double precision real or complex (CUSOLVER_R_FP64 or CUSOLVER_C_FP64), this residual will be of type real double precision (FP64) *double*, otherwise if the Inputs/Outputs datatype is single precision real or complex (CUSOLVER_R_FP32 or CUSOLVER_C_FP32), this residual will be real single precision FP32 *float*.

The residual history matrix consists of two columns (even for the multiple right-hand side case NRHS) of `MaxIters+1`

row, thus a matrix of size (`MaxIters+1,2`

). Only the first `OuterNiters+1`

rows contains the residual norms the other (e.g., OuterNiters+2:Maxiters+1) are garbage. On the first column, each row *“i”* specify the total number of iterations happened till this outer iteration *“i”* and on the second columns the residual norm corresponding to this outer iteration *“i”*. Thus, the first row (e.g., outer iteration *“0”*) consists of the initial residual (e.g., the residual before the refinement loop start) then the consecutive rows are the residual obtained at each outer iteration of the refinement loop. Note, it only consists of the history of the outer loop.

If the refinement solver was `CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_CLASSICAL`

or `CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_GMRES`

, then OuterNiters=Niters (Niters is the total number of iterations performed) and there is Niters+1 rows of norms that correspond to the Niters outer iterations.

If the refinement solver was `CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_CLASSICAL_GMRES`

or `CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_GMRES_GMRES`

, then OuterNiters <= Niters corresponds to the outer iterations performed by the outer refinement loop. Thus, there is OuterNiters+1 residual norms where row *“i”* correspond to the outer iteration *“i”* and the first column specify the total number of iterations (outer and inner) that were performed till this step the second columns correspond to the residual norm at this step.

For example, let’s say the user specifies `CUSOLVER_IRS_REFINE_CLASSICAL_GMRES`

as a refinement solver and say it needed 3 outer iterations to converge and 4,3,3 inner iterations at each outer, respectively. This consists of 10 total iterations. Row 0 corresponds to the first residual before the refinement start, so it has 0 in its first column. On row 1 which corresponds to the outer iteration 1, it will be 4 (4 is the total number of iterations that were performed till now), on row 2 it will be 7, and on row 3 it will be 10.

In summary, let’s define `ldh=Maxiters+1`

, the leading dimension of the residual matrix. then `residual_history[i]`

shows the total number of iterations performed at the outer iteration *“i”* and `residual_history[i+ldh]`

corresponds to the norm of the residual at this outer iteration.

This function computes the Cholesky factorization of a Hermitian positive-definite matrix.

`A`

is an \(n \times n\) Hermitian matrix, only the lower or upper part is meaningful. The input parameter `uplo`

indicates which part of the matrix is used. The function will leave the other part untouched.

If input parameter `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_LOWER`

, only the lower triangular part of `A`

is processed, and replaced by the lower triangular Cholesky factor `L`

.

If input parameter `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_UPPER`

, only upper triangular part of `A`

is processed, and replaced by upper triangular Cholesky factor `U`

.

The user has to provide working space which is pointed by input parameter `Workspace`

. The input parameter `Lwork`

is size of the working space, and it is returned by `potrf_bufferSize()`

.

If Cholesky factorization failed, i.e. some leading minor of `A`

is not positive definite, or equivalently some diagonal elements of `L`

or `U`

is not a real number. The output parameter `devInfo`

would indicate smallest leading minor of `A`

which is not positive definite.

If output parameter `devInfo = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle).

This function solves a system of linear equations

where `A`

is an \(n \times n\) Hermitian matrix, only lower or upper part is meaningful. The input parameter `uplo`

indicates which part of the matrix is used. The function will leave the other part untouched.

The user has to call `potrf`

first to factorize matrix `A`

is upper triangular Cholesky factor `U`

corresponding to \(A = U^{H}*U\) .

The operation is in-place, i.e. matrix `X`

overwrites matrix `B`

with the same leading dimension `ldb`

.

This function computes the LU factorization of an \(m \times n\) matrix

where `A`

is an \(m \times n\) matrix, `P`

is a permutation matrix, `L`

is a lower triangular matrix with unit diagonal, and `U`

is an upper triangular matrix.

The user has to provide working space which is pointed by input parameter `Workspace`

. The input parameter `Lwork`

is size of the working space, and it is returned by `getrf_bufferSize()`

.

If LU factorization failed, i.e. matrix `A`

(`U`

) is singular, The output parameter `devInfo=i`

indicates `U(i,i) = 0`

.

If output parameter `devInfo = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle).

If `devIpiv`

is null, no pivoting is performed. The factorization is `A=L*U`

, which is not numerically stable.

No matter LU factorization failed or not, the output parameter `devIpiv`

contains pivoting sequence, row `i`

is interchanged with row `devIpiv(i)`

.

The user can combine `getrf`

and `getrs`

to complete a linear solver.

Remark: `getrf`

uses fastest implementation with large workspace of size `m*n`

. The user can choose the legacy implementation with minimal workspace by `Getrf`

2.4.2.6. cusolverDn<t1><t2>gesv()[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdn-t1-t2-gesv)

These functions are modelled after functions DSGESV and ZCGESV from LAPACK. They compute the solution of a system of linear equations with one or multiple right hand sides using mixed precision iterative refinement techniques based on the LU factorization `Xgesv`

. These functions are similar in term of functionalities to the full precision LU solver (`Xgesv`

, where X denotes Z,C,D,S) but it uses lower precision internally in order to provide faster time to solution, from here comes the name mixed precision. Mixed precision iterative refinement techniques means that the solver compute an LU factorization in lower precision and then iteratively refine the solution to achieve the accuracy of the Inputs/Outputs datatype precision. The <t1> corresponds to the Inputs/Outputs datatype precision while <t2> represent the internal lower precision at which the factorization will be carried on.

Where `A`

is `n-by-n`

matrix and `X`

and `B`

are `n-by-nrhs`

matrices.

Functions API are designed to be as close as possible to LAPACK API to be considered as a quick and easy drop-in replacement. Parameters and behavior are mostly the same as LAPACK counterparts. Description of these functions and differences from LAPACK is given below. `<t1><t2>gesv()`

functions are designated by two floating point precisions The <t1> corresponds to the main precision (e.g., Inputs/Outputs datatype precision) and the <t2> represent the internal lower precision at which the factorization will be carried on. `cusolver<t1><t2>gesv()`

first attempts to factorize the matrix in lower precision and use this factorization within an iterative refinement procedure to obtain a solution with same normwise backward error as the main precision <t1>. If the approach fails to converge, then the method fallback to the main precision factorization and solve (Xgesv) such a way that there is always a good solution at the output of these functions. If <t2> is equal to <t1>, then it is not a mixed precision process but rather a full one precision factorization, solve and refinement within the same main precision.

The iterative refinement process is stopped if


`ITER > ITERMAX`


or for all the RHS we have:


`RNRM < SQRT(N)*XNRM*ANRM*EPS*BWDMAX`


where

ITER is the number of the current iteration in the iterative refinement process

RNRM is the infinity-norm of the residual

XNRM is the infinity-norm of the solution

ANRM is the infinity-operator-norm of the matrix A

EPS is the machine epsilon that matches LAPACK <t1>LAMCH(‘Epsilon’)


The value ITERMAX and BWDMAX are fixed to 50 and 1.0 respectively.

The function returns value describes the results of the solving process. A `CUSOLVER_STATUS_SUCCESS`

indicates that the function finished with success otherwise, it indicates if one of the API arguments is incorrect, or if the function did not finish with success. More details about the error will be in the `niters`

and the `dinfo`

API parameters. See their description below for more details. User should provide the required workspace allocated on device memory. The amount of bytes required can be queried by calling the respective function `<t1><t2>gesv_bufferSize()`

.

Note that in addition to the two mixed precision functions available in LAPACK (for example, `dsgesv`

and `zcgesv`

), we provide a large set of mixed precision functions that include half, bfloat and tensorfloat as a lower precision as well as same precision functions (, main and lowest precision are equal <t2> is equal to <t1>). The following table specifies which precisions will be used for which interface function.

Tensor Float (TF32), introduced with NVIDIA Ampere Architecture GPUs, is the most robust tensor core accelerated compute mode for the iterative refinement solver. It is able to solve the widest range of problems in HPC arising from different applications and provides up to 4X and 5X speedup for real and complex systems, respectively. On Volta and Turing architecture GPUs, half precision tensor core acceleration is recommended. In cases where the iterative refinement solver fails to converge to the desired accuracy (main precision, INOUT data precision), it is recommended to use main precision as internal lowest precision (i.e., `cusolverDn[DD,ZZ]gesv`

for the FP64 case).

2.4.2.7. cusolverDnIRSXgesv()[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdnirsxgesv)

This function is designed to perform same functionality as `cusolverDn<T1><T2>gesv()`

functions, but wrapped in a more generic and expert interface that gives user more control to parametrize the function as well as it provides more information on output. `cusolverDnIRSXgesv()`

allows additional control of the solver parameters such as setting:

the main precision (Inputs/Outputs precision) of the solver

the lowest precision to be used internally by the solver

the refinement solver type

the maximum allowed number of iterations in the refinement phase

the tolerance of the refinement solver

the fallback to main precision

and more


through the configuration parameters structure `gesv_irs_params`

and its helper functions. For more details about what configuration can be set and its meaning please refer to all the functions in the cuSolverDN Helper Function Section that start with `cusolverDnIRSParamsxxxx()`

. Moreover, `cusolverDnIRSXgesv()`

provides additional information on the output such as the convergence history (e.g., the residual norms) at each iteration and the number of iterations needed to converge. For more details about what information can be retrieved and its meaning please refer to all the functions in the cuSolverDN Helper Function Section that start with `cusolverDnIRSInfosxxxx()`


The function returns value describes the results of the solving process. A CUSOLVER_STATUS_SUCCESS indicates that the function finished with success otherwise, it indicates if one of the API arguments is incorrect, or if the configurations of params/infos structure is incorrect or if the function did not finish with success. More details about the error can be found by checking the `niters`

and the `dinfo`

API parameters. See their description below for further details. User should provide the required workspace allocated on device for the `cusolverDnIRSXgesv()`

function. The amount of bytes required for the function can be queried by calling the respective function `cusolverDnIRSXgesv_bufferSize()`

. Note that, if the user would like a particular configuration to be set via the params structure, it should be set before the call to `cusolverDnIRSXgesv_bufferSize()`

to get the size of the required workspace.

Tensor Float (TF32), introduced with NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs, is the most robust tensor core accelerated compute mode for the iterative refinement solver. It is able to solve the widest range of problems in HPC arising from different applications and provides up to 4X and 5X speedup for real and complex systems, respectively. On Volta and Turing architecture GPUs, half precision tensor core acceleration is recommended. In cases where the iterative refinement solver fails to converge to the desired accuracy (main precision, INOUT data precision), it is recommended to use main precision as internal lowest precision.

The following table provides all possible combinations values for the lowest precision corresponding to the Inputs/Outputs data type. Note that if the lowest precision matches the Inputs/Outputs datatype, then the main precision factorization will be used.

2.4.2.9. cusolverDn<t1><t2>gels()[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdn-t1-t2-gels)

These functions compute the solution of a system of linear equations with one or multiple right hand sides using mixed precision iterative refinement techniques based on the QR factorization Xgels. These functions are similar in term of functionalities to the full precision LAPACK QR (least squares) solver (Xgels, where X denotes Z,C,D,S) but it uses lower precision internally in order to provide faster time to solution, from here comes the name mixed precision. Mixed precision iterative refinement techniques means that the solver compute an QR factorization in lower precision and then iteratively refine the solution to achieve the accuracy of the Inputs/Outputs datatype precision. The <t1> corresponds to the Inputs/Outputs datatype precision while <t2> represent the internal lower precision at which the factorization will be carried on.

Where `A`

is `m-by-n`

matrix and `X`

is `n-by-nrhs`

and `B`

is `m-by-nrhs`

matrices.

Functions API are designed to be as close as possible to LAPACK API to be considered as a quick and easy drop-in replacement. Description of these functions is given below. `<t1><t2>gels()`

functions are designated by two floating point precisions The `<t1>`

corresponds to the main precision (e.g., Inputs/Outputs datatype precision) and the `<t2>`

represent the internal lower precision at which the factorization will be carried on. `cusolver<t1><t2>gels()`

first attempts to factorize the matrix in lower precision and use this factorization within an iterative refinement procedure to obtain a solution with same normwise backward error as the main precision `<t1>`

. If the approach fails to converge, then the method fallback to the main precision factorization and solve (Xgels) such a way that there is always a good solution at the output of these functions. If `<t2>`

is equal to `<t1>`

, then it is not a mixed precision process but rather a full one precision factorization, solve and refinement within the same main precision.

The iterative refinement process is stopped if:

`ITER > ITERMAX`


or for all the RHS we have:

`RNRM < SQRT(N)*XNRM*ANRM*EPS*BWDMAX`


where

ITER is the number of the current iteration in the iterative refinement process

RNRM is the infinity-norm of the residual

XNRM is the infinity-norm of the solution

ANRM is the infinity-operator-norm of the matrix A

EPS is the machine epsilon that matches

`LAPACK<t1>LAMCH('Epsilon')`


The values ITERMAX and BWDMAX are fixed to 50 and 1.0 respectively.

The function returns value describes the results of the solving process. A `CUSOLVER_STATUS_SUCCESS`

indicates that the function finished with success otherwise, it indicates if one of the API arguments is incorrect, or if the function did not finish with success. More details about the error will be in the `niters`

and the `dinfo`

API parameters. See their description below for more details. User should provide the required workspace allocated on device memory. The amount of bytes required can be queried by calling the respective function `<t1><t2>gels_bufferSize()`

.

We provide a large set of mixed precision functions that include half, bfloat and tensorfloat as a lower precision as well as same precision functions (e.g., main and lowest precision are equal `<t2>`

is equal to `<t1>`

). The following table specifies which precisions will be used for which interface function:

Tensor Float (TF32), introduced with NVIDIA Ampere Architecture GPUs, is the most robust tensor core accelerated compute mode for the iterative refinement solver. It is able to solve the widest range of problems in HPC arising from different applications and provides up to 4X and 5X speedup for real and complex systems, respectively. On Volta and Turing architecture GPUs, half precision tensor core acceleration is recommended. In cases where the iterative refinement solver fails to converge to the desired accuracy (main precision, INOUT data precision), it is recommended to use main precision as internal lowest precision (i.e., `cusolverDn[DD,ZZ]gels`

for the FP64 case).

2.4.2.10. cusolverDnIRSXgels()[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolverdnirsxgels)

This function is designed to perform same functionality as `cusolverDn<T1><T2>gels()`

functions, but wrapped in a more generic and expert interface that gives user more control to parametrize the function as well as it provides more information on output. `cusolverDnIRSXgels()`

allows additional control of the solver parameters such as setting:

the main precision (Inputs/Outputs precision) of the solver,

the lowest precision to be used internally by the solver,

the refinement solver type

the maximum allowed number of iterations in the refinement phase

the tolerance of the refinement solver

the fallback to main precision

and others


through the configuration parameters structure `gels_irs_params`

and its helper functions. For more details about what configuration can be set and its meaning please refer to all the functions in the cuSolverDN Helper Function Section that start with `cusolverDnIRSParamsxxxx()`

. Moreover, `cusolverDnIRSXgels()`

provides additional information on the output such as the convergence history (e.g., the residual norms) at each iteration and the number of iterations needed to converge. For more details about what information can be retrieved and its meaning please refer to all the functions in the cuSolverDN Helper Function Section that start with `cusolverDnIRSInfosxxxx()`

.

The function returns value describes the results of the solving process. A CUSOLVER_STATUS_SUCCESS indicates that the function finished with success otherwise, it indicates if one of the API arguments is incorrect, or if the configurations of params/infos structure is incorrect or if the function did not finish with success. More details about the error can be found by checking the `niters`

and the `dinfo`

API parameters. See their description below for further details. Users should provide the required workspace allocated on device for the `cusolverDnIRSXgels()`

function. The amount of bytes required for the function can be queried by calling the respective function `cusolverDnIRSXgels_bufferSize()`

. Note that, if the user would like a particular configuration to be set via the params structure, it should be set before the call to `cusolverDnIRSXgels_bufferSize()`

to get the size of the required workspace.

The following table provides all possible combinations values for the lowest precision corresponding to the Inputs/Outputs data type. Note that if the lowest precision matches the Inputs/Outputs datatype, then main precision factorization will be used

Tensor Float (TF32), introduced with NVIDIA Ampere Architecture GPUs, is the most robust tensor core accelerated compute mode for the iterative refinement solver. It is able to solve the widest range of problems in HPC arising from different applications and provides up to 4X and 5X speedup for real and complex systems, respectively. On Volta and Turing architecture GPUs, half precision tensor core acceleration is recommended. In cases where the iterative refinement solver fails to converge to the desired accuracy (main precision, INOUT data precision), it is recommended to use main precision as internal lowest precision.

This function computes the factorization of a symmetric indefinite matrix using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting.

`A`

is a \(n \times n\) symmetric matrix, only lower or upper part is meaningful. The input parameter `uplo`

indicates which part of the matrix is used. If `devIpiv`

is null, no pivoting is performed, which is not numerically stable.

If input parameter `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_LOWER`

, only lower triangular part of `A`

is processed, and replaced by lower triangular factor `L`

and block diagonal matrix `D`

. Each block of `D`

is either 1x1 or 2x2 block, depending on pivoting.

If input parameter `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_UPPER`

, only upper triangular part of `A`

is processed, and replaced by upper triangular factor `U`

and block diagonal matrix `D`

.

The user has to provide working space which is pointed by input parameter `work`

. The input parameter `lwork`

is size of the working space, and it is returned by `sytrf_bufferSize()`

. Please note that the size in bytes of the working space is equal to `sizeof(<type>) * lwork`

. When no pivoting is performed, the other triangular part of the input matrix `A`

is used as workspace.

If Bunch-Kaufman factorization failed, i.e. `A`

is singular. The output parameter `devInfo = i`

would indicate `D(i,i)=0`

.

If output parameter `devInfo = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle).

The output parameter `devIpiv`

contains pivoting sequence. If `devIpiv(i) = k > 0`

, `D(i,i)`

is 1x1 block, and `i-th`

row/column of `A`

is interchanged with `k-th`

row/column of `A`

. If `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_UPPER`

and `devIpiv(i-1) = devIpiv(i) = -m < 0`

, `D(i-1:i,i-1:i)`

is a 2x2 block, and `(i-1)-th`

row/column is interchanged with `m-th`

row/column. If `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_LOWER`

and `devIpiv(i+1) = devIpiv(i) = -m < 0`

This function computes the Cholesky factorization of a sequence of Hermitian positive-definite matrices.

Each `Aarray[i] for i=0,1,..., batchSize-1`

is a \(n \times n\) Hermitian matrix, only lower or upper part is meaningful. The input parameter `uplo`

indicates which part of the matrix is used.

If input parameter `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_LOWER`

, only lower triangular part of `A`

is processed, and replaced by lower triangular Cholesky factor `L`

.

If input parameter `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_UPPER`

, only upper triangular part of `A`

is processed, and replaced by upper triangular Cholesky factor `U`

.

If Cholesky factorization failed, i.e. some leading minor of `A`

is not positive definite, or equivalently some diagonal elements of `L`

or `U`

is not a real number. The output parameter `infoArray`

would indicate smallest leading minor of `A`

which is not positive definite.

`infoArray`

is an integer array of size `batchsize`

. If `potrfBatched`

returns `CUSOLVER_STATUS_INVALID_VALUE`

, `infoArray[0] = -i`

(less than zero), meaning that the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle). If `potrfBatched`

returns `CUSOLVER_STATUS_SUCCESS`

but `infoArray[i] = k`

is positive, then `i-th`

matrix is not positive definite and the Cholesky factorization failed at row `k`

.

Remark: the other part of `A`

is used as a workspace. For example, if `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_UPPER`

, upper triangle of `A`

contains Cholesky factor `U`

and lower triangle of `A`

is destroyed after `potrfBatched`

.

```

This function solves a sequence of linear systems

where each `Aarray[i] for i=0,1,..., batchSize-1`

is a \(n \times n\) Hermitian matrix, only lower or upper part is meaningful. The input parameter `uplo`

indicates which part of the matrix is used.

The user has to call `potrfBatched`

first to factorize matrix `Aarray[i]`

. If input parameter `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_LOWER`

, `A`

is lower triangular Cholesky factor `L`

corresponding to \(A = L*L^{H}\) . If input parameter `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_UPPER`

, `A`

is upper triangular Cholesky factor `U`

corresponding to \(A = U^{H}*U\) .

The operation is in-place, i.e. matrix `X`

overwrites matrix `B`

with the same leading dimension `ldb`

.

The output parameter `info`

is a scalar. If `info = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle).

Remark 1: only `nrhs=1`

is supported.

Remark 2: `infoArray`

from `potrfBatched`

indicates if the matrix is positive definite. `info`

from `potrsBatched`

only shows which input parameter is wrong (not counting handle).

Remark 3: the other part of `A`

is used as a workspace. For example, if `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_UPPER`

, upper triangle of `A`

contains Cholesky factor `U`

and lower triangle of `A`

is destroyed after `potrsBatched`

.

The matrix `Q`

and `P`

are overwritten into matrix `A`

in the following sense:

if

`m>=n`

, the diagonal and the first superdiagonal are overwritten with the upper bidiagonal matrix`B`

; the elements below the diagonal, with the array`TAUQ`

, represent the orthogonal matrix`Q`

as a product of elementary reflectors, and the elements above the first superdiagonal, with the array`TAUP`

determined by `gebrd`

when reducing a matrix A to bidiagonal form: \(Q^{H}*A*P = B\)

`Q`

and `P**H`

are defined as products of elementary reflectors H(i) or G(i) respectively.

The user has to provide working space which is pointed by input parameter `work`

. The input parameter `lwork`

is size of the working space, and it is returned by `orgbr_bufferSize()`

This function reduces a general symmetric (Hermitian) \(n \times n\) matrix `A`

to real symmetric tridiagonal form `T`

by an orthogonal transformation: \(Q^{H}*A*Q = T\)

As an output, `A`

contains `T`

and householder reflection vectors. If `uplo`

= `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_UPPER`

, the diagonal and first superdiagonal of `A`

are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal matrix `T`

, and the elements above the first superdiagonal, with the array `tau`

, represent the orthogonal matrix `Q`

as a product of elementary reflectors; If `uplo`

= `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_LOWER`

, the diagonal and first subdiagonal of `A`

are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal matrix `T`

, and the elements below the first subdiagonal, with the array `tau`

, represent the orthogonal matrix `Q`

as a product of elementary reflectors.

The user has to provide working space which is pointed by input parameter `work`

. The input parameter `lwork`

is size of the working space, and it is returned by `sytrd_bufferSize()`

.

If output parameter `devInfo = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle). Note that the problem size `n`

is limited by a condition `n*lda < INT32_MAX`

primarily due to the current implementation constraints.

This function computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of an \(m \times n\) matrix `A`

and corresponding the left and/or right singular vectors. The SVD is written

where `Σ`

is an \(m \times n\) matrix which is zero except for its `min(m,n)`

diagonal elements, `U`

is an \(m \times m\) unitary matrix, and `V`

is an \(n \times n\) unitary matrix. The diagonal elements of `Σ`

are the singular values of `A`

; they are real and non-negative, and are returned in descending order. The first `min(m,n)`

columns of `U`

and `V`

are the left and right singular vectors of `A`

.

The user has to provide working space which is pointed by input parameter `work`

. The input parameter `lwork`

is size of the working space, and it is returned by `gesvd_bufferSize()`

. Please note that the size in bytes of the working space is equal to `sizeof(<type>) * lwork`

.

If output parameter `devInfo = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle). if `bdsqr`

did not converge, `devInfo`

specifies how many superdiagonals of an intermediate bidiagonal form did not converge to zero.

The `rwork`

is real array of dimension (min(m,n)-1). If `devInfo`

>0 and `rwork`

is not NULL, `rwork`

contains the unconverged superdiagonal elements of an upper bidiagonal matrix. This is slightly different from LAPACK which puts unconverged superdiagonal elements in `work`

if type is `real`

; in `rwork`

if type is `complex`

. `rwork`

can be a NULL pointer if the user does not want the information from superdiagonal.

Please visit [cuSOLVER Library Samples - gesvd](https://github.com/NVIDIA/CUDALibrarySamples/tree/main/cuSOLVER/gesvd) for a code example.

Remark 1: `gesvd`

only supports `m>=n`

This function computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of an \(m \times n\) matrix `A`

and corresponding the left and/or right singular vectors. The SVD is written:

where `Σ`

is an \(m \times n\) matrix which is zero except for its `min(m,n)`

diagonal elements, `U`

is an \(m \times m\) unitary matrix, and `V`

is an \(n \times n\) unitary matrix. The diagonal elements of `Σ`

are the singular values of `A`

; they are real and non-negative, and are returned in descending order. The first `min(m,n)`

columns of `U`

and `V`

are the left and right singular vectors of `A`

.

`gesvdj`

has the same functionality as `gesvd`

. The difference is that `gesvd`

uses QR algorithm and `gesvdj`

uses Jacobi method. The parallelism of Jacobi method gives GPU better performance on small and medium size matrices. Moreover the user can configure `gesvdj`

to perform approximation up to certain accuracy.

`gesvdj`

iteratively generates a sequence of unitary matrices to transform matrix `A`

to the following form

where `S`

is diagonal and diagonal of `E`

is zero.

During the iterations, the Frobenius norm of `E`

decreases monotonically. As `E`

goes down to zero, `S`

is the set of singular values. In practice, Jacobi method stops if

where `eps`

is given tolerance. Note that if the real residual norm

is computed, it will differ from \({\|{E}\|}_{F}\) up to roundoff errors of order \(N = max(m, n)\), to still have the standard SVD accuracy expectation

\(O(N)\) is typically \(N\), but the constant depends on the number of sweeps, which gives an upper roundoff error bound of \(sweeps * N\).

`gesvdj`

has two parameters to control the accuracy. First parameter is tolerance (`eps`

). The default value is machine accuracy but The user can use function `cusolverDnXgesvdjSetTolerance`

to set a priori tolerance. The second parameter is maximum number of sweeps which controls number of iterations of Jacobi method. The default value is 100 but the user can use function `cusolverDnXgesvdjSetMaxSweeps`

to set a proper bound. The experiments show 15 sweeps are good enough to converge to machine accuracy. `gesvdj`

stops either tolerance is met or maximum number of sweeps is met.

Jacobi method has quadratic convergence, so the accuracy is not proportional to number of sweeps. To guarantee certain accuracy, the user should configure tolerance only.

The user has to provide working space which is pointed by input parameter `work`

. The input parameter `lwork`

is the size of the working space, and it is returned by `gesvdj_bufferSize()`

. Please note that the size in bytes of the working space is equal to `sizeof(<type>) * lwork`

.

If output parameter `info = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle). If `info = min(m,n)+1`

, `gesvdj`

does not converge under given tolerance and maximum sweeps.

If the user sets an improper tolerance, `gesvdj`

may not converge. For example, tolerance should not be smaller than machine accuracy.

Please visit [cuSOLVER Library Samples - gesvdj](https://github.com/NVIDIA/CUDALibrarySamples/tree/main/cuSOLVER/gesvdj) for a code example.

Remark 1: `gesvdj`

supports any combination of `m`

and `n`

.

Remark 2: the routine returns `V`

, not \(V^{H}\) . This is different from `gesvd`

.

This function computes singular values and singular vectors of a sequence of general \(m \times n\) matrices

where \(\Sigma_{j}\) is a real \(m \times n\) diagonal matrix which is zero except for its `min(m,n)`

diagonal elements. \(U_{j}\) (left singular vectors) is an \(m \times m\) unitary matrix and \(V_{j}\) (right singular vectors) is a \(n \times n\) unitary matrix. The diagonal elements of \(\Sigma_{j}\) are the singular values of \(A_{j}\) in either descending order or non-sorting order.

`gesvdjBatched`

performs `gesvdj`

on each matrix. It requires that all matrices are of the same size `m,n`

no greater than 32 and are packed in contiguous way,

Each matrix is column-major with leading dimension `lda`

, so the formula for random access is \(A_{k}\operatorname{(i,j)} = {A\lbrack\ i\ +\ lda*j\ +\ lda*n*k\rbrack}\) .

The parameter `S`

also contains singular values of each matrix in contiguous way,

The formula for random access of `S`

is \(S_{k}\operatorname{(j)} = {S\lbrack\ j\ +\ min(m,n)*k\rbrack}\) .

Except for tolerance and maximum sweeps, `gesvdjBatched`

can either sort the singular values in descending order (default) or chose as-is (without sorting) by the function `cusolverDnXgesvdjSetSortEig`

. If the user packs several tiny matrices into diagonal blocks of one matrix, non-sorting option can separate singular values of those tiny matrices.

`gesvdjBatched`

cannot report residual and executed sweeps by function `cusolverDnXgesvdjGetResidual`

and `cusolverDnXgesvdjGetSweeps`

. Any call of the above two returns `CUSOLVER_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED`

. The user needs to compute residual explicitly.

The user has to provide working space pointed by input parameter `work`

. The input parameter `lwork`

is the size of the working space, and it is returned by `gesvdjBatched_bufferSize()`

. Please note that the size in bytes of the working space is equal to `sizeof(<type>) * lwork`

.

The output parameter `info`

is an integer array of size `batchSize`

. If the function returns `CUSOLVER_STATUS_INVALID_VALUE`

, the first element `info[0] = -i`

(less than zero) indicates `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle). Otherwise, if `info[i] = min(m,n)+1`

, `gesvdjBatched`

does not converge on `i-th`

matrix under given tolerance and maximum sweeps.

This function `gesvda`

(`a`

stands for approximate) approximates the singular value decomposition of a tall skinny \(m \times n\) matrix `A`

and corresponding the left and right singular vectors. The economy form of SVD is written by

where `Σ`

is an \(n \times n\) matrix. `U`

is an \(m \times n\) unitary matrix, and `V`

is an \(n \times n\) unitary matrix. The diagonal elements of `Σ`

are the singular values of `A`

; they are real and non-negative, and are returned in descending order. `U`

and `V`

are the left and right singular vectors of `A`

.

`gesvda`

computes eigenvalues of `A**T*A`

, or `A**H*A`

(if `A`

is complex), to approximate singular values and singular vectors. It generates matrices `U`

and `V`

and transforms the matrix `A`

to the following form

where `S`

is diagonal and `E`

depends on rounding errors. To certain conditions, `U`

, `V`

and `S`

approximate singular values and singular vectors up to machine zero of single precision. In general, `V`

is unitary, `S`

is more accurate than `U`

. If singular value is far from zero, then left singular vector `U`

is accurate. In other words, the accuracy of singular values and left singular vectors depend on the distance between singular value and zero. Since the computation of `A**T*A`

, or `A**H*A`

can greatly amplify errors, it is recommended to use `gesvda`

only with well-conditioned data.

The input parameter `rank`

decides the number of singular values and singular vectors are computed in parameter `S`

, `U`

and `V`

.

The output parameter `h_RnrmF`

computes Frobenius norm of residual. To compute `h_RnrmF`

, `info != NULL`

is required.

if the parameter `rank`

is equal `n`

. Otherwise, `h_RnrmF`

reports

in Frobenius norm sense, that is, how far `U`

is from unitary.

`gesvdaStridedBatched`

performs `gesvda`

on each matrix. It requires that all matrices are of the same size `m,n`

and are packed in a contiguous way,

Each matrix is column-major with leading dimension `lda`

, so the formula for random access is \(A_{k}\operatorname{(i,j)} = {A\lbrack\ i\ +\ lda*j\ +\ strideA*k\rbrack}\) . Similarly, the formula for random access of `S`

is \(S_{k}\operatorname{(j)} = {S\lbrack\ j\ +\ StrideS*k\rbrack}\) , the formula for random access of `U`

is \(U_{k}\operatorname{(i,j)} = {U\lbrack\ i\ +\ ldu*j\ +\ strideU*k\rbrack}\) and the formula for random access of `V`

is \(V_{k}\operatorname{(i,j)} = {V\lbrack\ i\ +\ ldv*j\ +\ strideV*k\rbrack}\) .

The user has to provide working space which is pointed by input parameter `work`

. The input parameter `lwork`

is the size of the working space, and it is returned by `gesvdaStridedBatched_bufferSize()`

. Please note that the size in bytes of the working space is equal to `sizeof(<type>) * lwork`

.

The output parameter `info`

is an integer array of size `batchSize`

. If the function returns `CUSOLVER_STATUS_INVALID_VALUE`

, the first element `info[0] = -i`

(less than zero) indicates `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle). Otherwise, if `info[i] = min(m,n)+1`

, `gesvdaStridedBatched`

did not converge on the `i-th`

matrix. If `0 < info[i] < min(m,n)+1`

, `gesvdaStridedBatched`

could not compute an SVD of the `i-th`

matrix fully; the leading singular values `Si[k]`

, `0 <= k <= info[i]-1`

, and corresponding singular vectors may still be useful. In this case, if `h_RnrmF`

is requested, `h_RnrmF`

reports the residual as if `rank`

was set to `info[i]-1`

.

Note that the problem size is limited by the condition `batchSize*stride{A/S/U/V}<=INT32_MAX`

primarily due to the current implementation constraints.

Please visit [cuSOLVER Library Samples - gesvdaStridedBatched](https://github.com/NVIDIA/CUDALibrarySamples/tree/main/cuSOLVER/gesvdaStridedBatched) for a code example.

Remark 1: The routine returns `V`

, not \(V^{H}\) . This is different from `gesvd`

.

Remark 2: The routine only supports `m >=n`

.

Remark 3: It is recommended to use an FP64 data type, that is `DgesvdaStridedBatched`

or `ZgesvdaStridedBatched`

.

Remark 4: If the user is confident on the accuracy of singular values and singular vectors, for example, certain conditions hold (required singular value is far from zero), then the performance can be improved by passing a null pointer to `h_RnrmF`

, i.e. no computation of the residual norm.

. The standard symmetric eigenvalue problem is

where `Λ`

is a real \(n \times n\) diagonal matrix. `V`

is an \(n \times n\) unitary matrix. The diagonal elements of `Λ`

are the eigenvalues of `A`

in ascending order.

The user has to provide working space which is pointed by input parameter `work`

. The input parameter `lwork`

is size of the working space, and it is returned by `syevd_bufferSize()`

. Please note that the size in bytes of the working space is equal to `sizeof(<type>) * lwork`

.

If output parameter `devInfo = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle). If `devInfo = i`

(greater than zero), `i`

off-diagonal elements of an intermediate tridiagonal form did not converge to zero.

If `jobz`

= CUSOLVER_EIG_MODE_VECTOR, `A`

contains the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix `A`

. The eigenvectors are computed by a divide and conquer algorithm.

This function computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric (Hermitian) \(n \times n\) matrix `A`

. The standard symmetric eigenvalue problem is

where `Λ`

is a real \(n \times n\) diagonal matrix. `Q`

is an \(n \times n\) unitary matrix. The diagonal elements of `Λ`

are the eigenvalues of `A`

in ascending order.

`syevj`

has the same functionality as `syevd`

. The difference is that `syevd`

uses QR algorithm and `syevj`

uses Jacobi method. The parallelism of Jacobi method gives GPU better performance on small and medium size matrices. Moreover the user can configure `syevj`

to perform approximation up to certain accuracy.

How does it work?

`syevj`

iteratively generates a sequence of unitary matrices to transform matrix `A`

to the following form

where `W`

is diagonal and `E`

is symmetric without diagonal.

During the iterations, the Frobenius norm of `E`

decreases monotonically. As `E`

goes down to zero, `W`

is the set of eigenvalues. In practice, Jacobi method stops if

where `eps`

is the given tolerance.

`syevj`

has two parameters to control the accuracy. First parameter is tolerance (`eps`

). The default value is machine accuracy but The user can use function `cusolverDnXsyevjSetTolerance`

to set a priori tolerance. The second parameter is maximum number of sweeps which controls number of iterations of Jacobi method. The default value is 100 but the user can use function `cusolverDnXsyevjSetMaxSweeps`

to set a proper bound. The experiments show 15 sweeps are good enough to converge to machine accuracy. `syevj`

stops either tolerance is met or maximum number of sweeps is met.

The Jacobi method has quadratic convergence, so the accuracy is not proportional to number of sweeps. To guarantee certain accuracy, the user should configure tolerance only.

After `syevj`

, the user can query residual by function `cusolverDnXsyevjGetResidual`

and number of executed sweeps by function `cusolverDnXsyevjGetSweeps`

. However the user needs to be aware that residual is the Frobenius norm of `E`

, not accuracy of individual eigenvalue, i.e.

The same as `syevd`

, the user has to provide working space pointed by input parameter `work`

. The input parameter `lwork`

is the size of the working space, and it is returned by `syevj_bufferSize()`

. Please note that the size in bytes of the working space is equal to `sizeof(<type>) * lwork`

.

If output parameter `info = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle). If `info = n+1`

, `syevj`

does not converge under given tolerance and maximum sweeps.

If the user sets an improper tolerance, `syevj`

may not converge. For example, tolerance should not be smaller than machine accuracy.

If `jobz`

= CUSOLVER_EIG_MODE_VECTOR, `A`

contains the orthonormal eigenvectors `V`

.

This function computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric (Hermitian) \(n \times n\) matrix-pair (`A`

,`B`

). The generalized symmetric-definite eigenvalue problem is

where the matrix `B`

is positive definite. `Λ`

is a real \(n \times n\) diagonal matrix. The diagonal elements of `Λ`

are the eigenvalues of (`A`

, `B`

) in ascending order. `V`

is an \(n \times n\) orthogonal matrix. The eigenvectors are normalized as follows:

This function has the same functionality as `sygvd`

except that `syevd`

in `sygvd`

is replaced by `syevj`

in `sygvj`

. Therefore, `sygvj`

inherits properties of `syevj`

, the user can use `cusolverDnXsyevjSetTolerance`

and `cusolverDnXsyevjSetMaxSweeps`

to configure tolerance and maximum sweeps.

However the meaning of residual is different from `syevj`

. `sygvj`

first computes Cholesky factorization of matrix `B`

,

transform the problem to standard eigenvalue problem, then calls `syevj`

.

For example, the standard eigenvalue problem of type I is

where matrix `M`

is symmetric

The residual is the result of `syevj`

on matrix `M`

, not `A`

.

The user has to provide working space which is pointed by input parameter `work`

. The input parameter `lwork`

is the size of the working space, and it is returned by `sygvj_bufferSize()`

. Please note that the size in bytes of the working space is equal to `sizeof(<type>) * lwork`

.

If output parameter `info = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle). If `info = i`

(i > 0 and i<=n), `B`

is not positive definite, the factorization of `B`

could not be completed and no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed. If `info = n+1`

, `syevj`

does not converge under given tolerance and maximum sweeps. In this case, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are still computed because non-convergence comes from improper tolerance of maximum sweeps.

if `jobz`

= CUSOLVER_EIG_MODE_VECTOR, `A`

contains the orthogonal eigenvectors `V`

.

This function computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a sequence of symmetric (Hermitian) \(n \times n\) matrices

where \(\Lambda_{j}\) is a real \(n \times n\) diagonal matrix. \(Q_j\) is an \(n \times n\) unitary matrix. The diagonal elements of \(\Lambda_j\) are the eigenvalues of \(A_j\) in either ascending order or non-sorting order.

`syevjBatched`

performs `syevj`

on each matrix. It requires that all matrices are of the same size `n`

and are packed in contiguous way,

Each matrix is column-major with leading dimension `lda`

, so the formula for random access is \(A_{k}\operatorname{(i,j)} = {A\lbrack\ i\ +\ lda*j\ +\ lda*n*k\rbrack}\) .

The parameter `W`

also contains eigenvalues of each matrix in contiguous way,

The formula for random access of `W`

is \(W_{k}\operatorname{(j)} = {W\lbrack\ j\ +\ n*k\rbrack}\) .

Except for tolerance and maximum sweeps, `syevjBatched`

can either sort the eigenvalues in ascending order (default) or chose as-is (without sorting) by the function `cusolverDnXsyevjSetSortEig`

. If the user packs several tiny matrices into diagonal blocks of one matrix, non-sorting option can separate spectrum of those tiny matrices.

`syevjBatched`

cannot report residual and executed sweeps by function `cusolverDnXsyevjGetResidual`

and `cusolverDnXsyevjGetSweeps`

. Any call of the above two returns `CUSOLVER_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED`

. The user needs to compute residual explicitly.

The user has to provide working space pointed by input parameter `work`

. The input parameter `lwork`

is the size of the working space, and it is returned by `syevjBatched_bufferSize()`

. Please note that the size in bytes of the working space is equal to `sizeof(<type>) * lwork`

.

The output parameter `info`

is an integer array of size `batchSize`

. If the function returns `CUSOLVER_STATUS_INVALID_VALUE`

, the first element `info[0] = -i`

(less than zero) indicates `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle). Otherwise, if `info[i] = n+1`

, `syevjBatched`

does not converge on `i-th`

matrix under given tolerance and maximum sweeps.

If `jobz`

= CUSOLVER_EIG_MODE_VECTOR, \(A_j\) contains the orthonormal eigenvectors \(V_j\).

computes the Cholesky factorization of a Hermitian positive-definite matrix using the generic API interface.

`A`

is a \(n \times n\) Hermitian matrix, only lower or upper part is meaningful. The input parameter `uplo`

indicates which part of the matrix is used. The function will leave the other part untouched.

If input parameter `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_LOWER`

, only lower triangular part of `A`

is processed, and replaced by lower triangular Cholesky factor `L`

.

If input parameter `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_UPPER`

, only upper triangular part of `A`

is processed, and replaced by upper triangular Cholesky factor `U`

.

The user has to provide device and host working spaces which are pointed by input parameters `bufferOnDevice`

and `bufferOnHost`

. The input parameters `workspaceInBytesOnDevice`

(and `workspaceInBytesOnHost`

) is size in bytes of the device (and host) working space, and it is returned by `cusolverDnXpotrf_bufferSize()`

.

If Cholesky factorization failed, i.e. some leading minor of `A`

is not positive definite, or equivalently some diagonal elements of `L`

or `U`

is not a real number. The output parameter `info`

would indicate smallest leading minor of `A`

which is not positive definite.

If output parameter `info = -i`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle).

computes the LU factorization of a \(m \times n\) matrix

where `A`

is a \(m \times n\) matrix, `P`

is a permutation matrix, `L`

is a lower triangular matrix with unit diagonal, and `U`

is an upper triangular matrix using the generic API interface.

If LU factorization failed, i.e. matrix `A`

(`U`

) is singular, The output parameter `info=i`

indicates `U(i,i) = 0`

.

If output parameter `info = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle).

If `ipiv`

is null, no pivoting is performed. The factorization is `A=L*U`

, which is not numerically stable.

No matter LU factorization failed or not, the output parameter `ipiv`

contains pivoting sequence, row `i`

is interchanged with row `ipiv(i)`

.

The user has to provide device and host working spaces which are pointed by input parameters `bufferOnDevice`

and `bufferOnHost`

. The input parameters `workspaceInBytesOnDevice`

(and `workspaceInBytesOnHost`

) is size in bytes of the device (and host) working space, and it is returned by `cusolverDnXgetrf_bufferSize()`

.

The user can combine `cusolverDnXgetrf`

and `cusolverDnGetrs`

to complete a linear solver.

Currently, `cusolverDnXgetrf`

supports two algorithms. To select legacy implementation, the user has to call `cusolverDnSetAdvOptions`

.

where `Σ`

columns of `U`

`cusolverDnXgesvdp`

combines polar decomposition in [14] and `cusolverDnXsyevd`

to compute SVD. It is much faster than `cusolverDnXgesvd`

which is based on QR algorithm. However polar decomposition in [14] may not deliver a full unitary matrix when the matrix A has a singular value close to zero. To workaround the issue when the singular value is close to zero, we add a small perturbation so polar decomposition can deliver the correct result. The consequence is inaccurate singular values shifted by this perturbation. The output parameter `h_err_sigma`

is the magnitude of this perturbation. In other words, `h_err_sigma`

shows the accuracy of SVD.

The user has to provide device and host working spaces which are pointed by input parameters `bufferOnDevice`

and `bufferOnHost`

. The input parameters `workspaceInBytesOnDevice`

(and `workspaceInBytesOnHost`

This function computes the approximated rank-k singular value decomposition (k-SVD) of an \(m \times n\) matrix `A`

and the corresponding left and/or right singular vectors. The k-SVD is written as

where `Σ`

is a \(k \times k\) matrix which is zero except for its diagonal elements, `U`

is an \(m \times k\) orthonormal matrix, and `V`

is an \(k \times n\) orthonormal matrix. The diagonal elements of `Σ`

are the approximated singular values of `A`

; they are real and non-negative, and are returned in descending order. The columns of `U`

and `V`

are the top-`k`

left and right singular vectors of `A`

.

`cusolverDnXgesvdr`

implements randomized methods described in [15] to compute k-SVD that is accurate with high probability if the conditions described in [15] hold. `cusolverDnXgesvdr`

is intended to compute a very small portion of the spectrum (meaning that `k`

is very small compared to `min(m,n)`

). of `A`

fast and with good quality, specially when the dimensions of the matrix are large.

The accuracy of the method depends on the spectrum of `A`

, the number of power iterations `niters`

, the oversampling parameter `p`

and the ratio between `p`

and the dimensions of the matrix `A`

. Larger values of oversampling `p`

or larger number of iterations `niters`

might produce more accurate approximations, but it will also increase the run time of `cusolverDnXgesvdr`

.

Our recommendation is to use two iterations and set the oversampling to at least `2k`

. Once the solver provides enough accuracy, adjust the values of `k`

and `niters`

for better performance.

The user has to provide device and host working spaces which are pointed by input parameters `bufferOnDevice`

and `bufferOnHost`

. The input parameters `workspaceInBytesOnDevice`

(and `workspaceInBytesOnHost`

) is size in bytes of the device (and host) working space, and it is returned by `cusolverDnXgesvdr_bufferSize()`

.

If output parameter `info = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle).

Currently, `cusolverDnXgesvdr`

supports only the default algorithm.

compute only the eigenvalues; `CUSOLVER_EIG_COMP_I`

compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the tridiagonal matrix; `CUSOLVER_EIG_COMP_V`

compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors as the product of the input matrix `Z`

The generalized symmetric-definite eigenvalue problem is

where the matrix `A`

and `B`

are \(n \times n\); A is symmetric/Hermitian and B is symmetrix/Hermitian positive definite. The eigenvalues of (`A`

, `B`

) are computed and stored in the `W`

vector in ascending order. `h_meig`

represents the number of eigenvalues/eigenvectors computed by the routine, `h_meig`

is equal to `n`

when the whole spectrum (for example, `range`

= `CUSOLVER_EIG_RANGE_ALL`

) is requested. `V`

is an \(n \times n\) orthogonal matrix. The eigenvectors are normalized as follows:

The user has to provide device and host working spaces which are pointed by input parameters `bufferOnDevice`

and `bufferOnHost`

. The input parameters `workspaceInBytesOnDevice`

(and `workspaceInBytesOnHost`

) is size in bytes of the device (and host) working space, and it is returned by `cusolverDnXsygvdx_bufferSize()`

.

If output parameter `info = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle). If `info = i`

(i > 0 and i<=n) and `jobz`

= CUSOLVER_EIG_MODE_NOVECTOR, `i`

off-diagonal elements of an intermediate tridiagonal form did not converge to zero. If `info = n + i`

(i > 0), then the leading minor of order `i`

of `B`

is not positive definite. The factorization of `B`

could not be completed and no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.

If `jobz`

= CUSOLVER_EIG_MODE_VECTOR, `A`

contains the orthogonal eigenvectors of the matrix `A`

. The eigenvectors are computed by divide and conquer algorithm.

computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a sequence of symmetric (Hermitian) \(n \times n\) matrices

where \(\Lambda_j\) is a real \(n \times n\) diagonal matrix. \(V_j\) is an \(n \times n\) unitary matrix. The diagonal elements of \(\Lambda_j\) are the eigenvalues of \(A_j\) in ascending order.

`syevBatched`

performs an eigendecomposition on each matrix. It requires that all matrices are of the same size `n`

and are packed in a contiguous way,

Each matrix is column-major with leading dimension `lda`

, so the formula for random access is \(A_{k}\operatorname{(i,j)} = {A\lbrack\ i\ +\ lda*j\ +\ lda*n*k\rbrack}\) .

The parameter `W`

also contains the eigenvalues of each matrix in a contiguous way,

The formula for random access of `W`

is \(W_{k}\operatorname{(j)} = {W\lbrack\ j\ +\ n*k\rbrack}\) .

The user has to provide device and host working space which are pointed to by the input parameters `bufferOnDevice`

and `bufferOnHost`

. The input parameters `workspaceInBytesOnDevice`

and `workspaceInBytesOnHost`

denote the size in bytes of the device and host working space, and returned by `cusolverDnXsyevBatched_bufferSize()`

.

The output parameter `info`

is an integer array of size `batchSize`

. If the function returns `CUSOLVER_STATUS_INVALID_VALUE`

, the first element `info[0] = -i`

(less than zero) indicates the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle). Otherwise, if `info[i] > 0`

, `syevBatched`

does not converge on the `i-th`

matrix.

If `jobz`

= CUSOLVER_EIG_MODE_VECTOR, \(A_{j}\) contains the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix \(A_{j}\).

Note that the problem size is limited by the condition `n*lda*batchSize<=INT32_MAX`

primarily due to the current implementation constraints.

computes for an n-by-n real non-symmetric or complex non-Hermitian matrix `A`

the eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors. The right eigenvector `v(j)`

of `A`

satisfies

where `w(j)`

is its eigenvalue. The left eigenvalue `u(j)`

of `A`

satisfies

where \(u(j)^{H}\) denotes the conjugate-transpose of `u(j)`

.

The computed eigenvectors are normalized to have Euclidean norm equal to 1 and largest component real.

If `A`

is real-valued, there are two options to return the eigenvalues in `W`

. The first options sets all data types to real-valued types. Then `W`

holds `2*n`

entries. The first n entries hold the real parts and the last n entries hold the imaginary parts. The LAPACK interface with separate arrays for the real parts `WR`

and the imaginary parts `WI`

can be recovered by settings pointers `WR = W`

, `WI = W+n`

. The second option uses a complex data type for `W`

. Then `W`

is n entries long; each real eigenvalue is stored as a complex number and for each complex conjugate pair, both eigenvalues are returned. The computation is still executed fully in real arithmetic.

The user has to provide device and host working space which are pointed to by the input parameters `bufferOnDevice`

and `bufferOnHost`

. The input parameters `workspaceInBytesOnDevice`

and `workspaceInBytesOnHost`

denote the size in bytes of the device and host working space, and returned by `cusolverDnXgeev_bufferSize()`

.

If the output parameter `info = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle). If `info = 0`

, the QR algorithm converged and `W`

contains the computed eigenvalues of `A`

and, if requested, the corresponding left and/or right eigenvectors have been computed. If `info = i`

(greater than zero), the QR algorithm failed to compute all the eigenvalues and no eigenvectors have been computed. The elements `i+1:n`

of `W`

contain eigenvalues which have converged.

Remark 1: `geev`

only supports the computation of right eigenvectors. So, `jobvl`

= `CUSOLVER_EIG_MODE_NOVECTOR`

must be set.

Remark 2: `geev`

uses balancing to improve the conditioning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Remark 3: `geev`

is a hybrid CPU-GPU algorithm. Best performance is attained with pinned host memory.

Currently, `cusolverDnXgeev`

supports only the default algorithm.

```

This function computes the polar decomposition of an \(m \times n\) matrix `A`

(where \(m \geq n\)). The polar decomposition is written

where \(U_p\) is an \(m \times n\) matrix with orthonormal columns and \(H\) is an \(n \times n\) Hermitian positive semidefinite matrix.

`cusolverDnXpolar`

uses the QDWH (QR-based Dynamically Weighted Halley) iteration [14][16] to compute \(U_p\). The QDWH iteration converges cubically and requires at most ~6 iterations. For ill-conditioned or rank-deficient matrices `A`

, the routine adds a small perturbation \(\xi\) to ensure the polar decomposition converges correctly. The output parameter `d_res_nrm`

reports the magnitude of the residual \(\|A - U_p \cdot H\|_2\).

The user has to provide device and host working spaces which are pointed by input parameters `bufferOnDevice`

and `bufferOnHost`

. The input parameters `workspaceInBytesOnDevice`

(and `workspaceInBytesOnHost`

) is size in bytes of the device (and host) working space, and it is returned by `cusolverDnXpolar_bufferSize()`

.

If output parameter `info = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle).

Currently, `cusolverDnXpolar`

supports only the default algorithm.

Remark 1: If `H`

is `NULL`

, computation of `H`

is skipped.

Remark 2: `uplo = CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_UPPER`

treats `A`

as upper triangular, saving one QR decomposition. `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_LOWER`

is not supported.

Remark 3: `d_res_nrm`

serves dual purpose. On input, if `*d_res_nrm >= 0`

, it overrides the perturbation \(\xi\) (skipping automatic search). On output, it reports the residual norm \(\|A - U_p \cdot H\|_2\).

This function solves the linear system

where `A`

is an \(n \times n\) sparse matrix that is defined in CSR storage format by the three arrays `csrValA`

, `csrRowPtrA`

, and `csrColIndA`

. `b`

is the right-hand-side vector of size `n`

, and `x`

is the solution vector of size `n`

.

The supported matrix type is `CUSPARSE_MATRIX_TYPE_GENERAL`

. If matrix `A`

is symmetric/Hermitian and only lower/upper part is used or meaningful, the user has to extend the matrix into its missing upper/lower part, otherwise the result would be wrong.

The linear system is solved by sparse LU with partial pivoting:

`cusolver`

library provides three reordering schemes, `symrcm`

`symamd`

, and `csrmetisnd`

to reduce zero fill-in which dramatically affects the performance of LU factorization. The input parameter `reorder`

can enable `symrcm`

(`symamd`

or `csrmetisnd`

) if `reorder`

is 1 (2, or 3), otherwise, no reordering is performed.

If `reorder`

is nonzero, `csrlsvlu`

does

where \(Q = {symrcm}(A + A^{T})\) .

If `A`

is singular under given tolerance (`max(tol,0)`

), then some diagonal elements of `U`

is zero, i.e.

The output parameter `singularity`

is the smallest index of such `j`

. If `A`

is non-singular, `singularity`

is -1. The index is base-0, independent of base index of `A`

. For example, if 2nd column of `A`

is the same as first column, then `A`

is singular and `singularity = 1`

which means `U(1,1)≈0`

.

Remark 1: `csrlsvlu`

performs traditional LU with partial pivoting, the pivot of k-th column is determined dynamically based on the k-th column of intermediate matrix. `csrlsvlu`

follows Gilbert and Peierls’s algorithm [4] which uses depth-first-search and topological ordering to solve triangular system (Davis also describes this algorithm in detail in his book [1]). Since CUDA 10.1, `csrlsvlu`

will incrementally reallocate the memory to store `L`

and `U`

. This feature can avoid over-estimate size from QR factorization. In some cases, zero fill-in of QR can be order of magnitude higher than LU.

Remark 2: only CPU (Host) path is provided.

This function solves the linear system

`A`

is an \(m \times m\) symmetric positive definite sparse matrix that is defined in CSR storage format by the three arrays `csrValA`

, `csrRowPtrA`

, and `csrColIndA`

. `b`

is the right-hand-side vector of size `m`

, and `x`

is the solution vector of size `m`

.

The supported matrix type is `CUSPARSE_MATRIX_TYPE_GENERAL`

and upper triangular part of `A`

is ignored (if parameter `reorder`

is zero). In other words, suppose input matrix `A`

is decomposed as \(A = L + D + U\) , where `L`

is lower triangular, `D`

is diagonal and `U`

is upper triangular. The function would ignore `U`

and regard `A`

as a symmetric matrix with the formula \(A = L + D + L^{H}\) . If parameter `reorder`

is nonzero, the user has to extend `A`

to a full matrix, otherwise the solution would be wrong.

The linear system is solved by sparse Cholesky factorization,

where `G`

is the Cholesky factor, a lower triangular matrix.

The output parameter `singularity`

has two meanings:

If

`A`

is not positive definite, there exists some integer`k`

such that`A(0:k, 0:k)`

is not positive definite.`singularity`

is the minimum of such`k`

.If

`A`

is positive definite but near singular under tolerance (`max(tol,0)`

), i.e. there exists some integer`k`

such that \(G\begin{pmatrix} {k,k} \\ \end{pmatrix}<={tol}\) .`singularity`

is the minimum of such`k`

.

`singularity`

is base-0. If `A`

is positive definite and not near singular under tolerance, `singularity`

is -1. If the user wants to know if `A`

is positive definite or not, `tol=0`

is enough.

`cusolver`

library provides three reordering schemes, `symrcm`

`symamd`

, and `csrmetisnd`

to reduce zero fill-in which dramatically affects the performance of Cholesky factorization. The input parameter `reorder`

can enable `symrcm`

(`symamd`

or `csrmetisnd`

) if `reorder`

is 1 (2, or 3), otherwise, no reordering is performed.

Remark 1: the function works for in-place (`x`

and `b`

point to the same memory block) and out-of-place.

Remark 2: the function only works on 32-bit index, if matrix `G`

has large zero fill-in such that number of nonzeros is bigger than \(2^{31}\) , then `CUSOLVER_STATUS_ALLOC_FAILED`

is returned.

This function solves the following least-square problem:

`A`

is an \(m \times n\) sparse matrix that is defined in CSR storage format by the three arrays `csrValA`

, `csrRowPtrA`

, and `csrColIndA`

. `b`

is the right-hand-side vector of size `m`

, and `x`

is the least-square solution vector of size `n`

.

The supported matrix type is `CUSPARSE_MATRIX_TYPE_GENERAL`

. If `A`

is square, symmetric/Hermitian and only lower/upper part is used or meaningful, the user has to extend the matrix into its missing upper/lower part, otherwise the result is wrong.

This function only works if `m`

is greater or equal to `n`

, in other words, `A`

is a tall matrix.

The least-square problem is solved by sparse QR factorization with column pivoting,

If `A`

is of full rank (i.e. all columns of `A`

are linear independent), then matrix `P`

is an identity. Suppose rank of `A`

is `k`

, less than `n`

, the permutation matrix `P`

reorders columns of `A`

in the following sense:

where \(R_{11}\) and `A`

have the same rank, but \(R_{22}\) is almost zero, i.e. every column of \(A_{2}\) is linear combination of \(A_{1}\) .

The input parameter `tol`

decides numerical rank. The absolute value of every entry in \(R_{22}\) is less than or equal to `tolerance=max(tol,0)`

.

The output parameter `rankA`

denotes numerical rank of `A`

.

Suppose \(y = P*x\) and \(c = Q^{H}*b\) , the least square problem can be reformed by

or in matrix form

The output parameter `min_norm`

is \(\left. \|c_{2} \right.\|\) , which is minimum value of least-square problem.

If `A`

is not of full rank, above equation does not have a unique solution. The least-square problem is equivalent to

Or equivalently another least-square problem

The output parameter `x`

is \(P^{T}*y\) , the solution of least-square problem.

The output parameter `p`

is a vector of size `n`

. It corresponds to a permutation matrix `P`

. `p(i)=j`

means `(P*x)(i) = x(j)`

. If `A`

is of full rank, `p=0:n-1`

.

Remark 1: `p`

is always base 0, independent of base index of `A`

.

Remark 2: only CPU (Host) path is provided.

This function solves the simple eigenvalue problem \(A*x = \lambda*x\) by shift-inverse method.

`A`

is an \(m \times m\) sparse matrix that is defined in CSR storage format by the three arrays `csrValA`

, `csrRowPtrA`

, and `csrColIndA`

. The output parameter `x`

is the approximated eigenvector of size `m`

,

The following shift-inverse method corrects eigenpair step-by-step until convergence.

It accepts several parameters:

`mu0`

is an initial guess of eigenvalue. The shift-inverse method will converge to the eigenvalue `mu`

nearest `mu0`

if `mu`

is a singleton. Otherwise, the shift-inverse method may not converge.

`x0`

is an initial eigenvector. If the user has no preference, just chose `x0`

randomly. `x0`

must be nonzero. It can be non-unit length.

`tol`

is the tolerance to decide convergence. If `tol`

is less than zero, it would be treated as zero.

`maxite`

is maximum number of iterations. It is useful when shift-inverse method does not converge because the tolerance is too small or the desired eigenvalue is not a singleton.

**Shift-Inverse Method**

Given an initial guess of eigenvalue μ0 and initial vector x0

The supported matrix type is `CUSPARSE_MATRIX_TYPE_GENERAL`

. If `A`

is symmetric/Hermitian and only lower/upper part is used or meaningful, the user has to extend the matrix into its missing upper/lower part, otherwise the result is wrong.

Remark 1: `[cu|h]solver[S|D]csreigvsi`

only allows `mu0`

as a real number. This works if `A`

is symmetric. Otherwise, the non-real eigenvalue has a conjugate counterpart on the complex plan, and shift-inverse method would not converge to such eigenvalue even the eigenvalue is a singleton. The user has to extend `A`

to complex numbers and call `[cu|h]solver[C|Z]csreigvsi`

with `mu0`

not on real axis.

Remark 2: the tolerance `tol`

should not be smaller than |mu0|*eps, where eps is machine zero. Otherwise, shift-inverse may not converge because of small tolerance.

This function computes number of algebraic eigenvalues in a given box `B`

by contour integral

where closed line `C`

is boundary of the box `B`

which is a rectangle specified by two points, one is left bottom corner (input parameter `left_bottom_corner`

) and the other is right upper corner (input parameter `right_upper_corner`

). `P(z)=det(A - z*I)`

is the characteristic polynomial of `A`

.

`A`

is an \(m \times m\) sparse matrix that is defined in CSR storage format by the three arrays `csrValA`

, `csrRowPtrA`

, and `csrColIndA`

.

The output parameter `num_eigs`

is number of algebraic eigenvalues in the box `B`

. This number may not be accurate due to several reasons:

The contour

`C`

is close to some eigenvalues or even passes through some eigenvalues.The numerical integration is not accurate due to coarse grid size. The default resolution is 1200 grids along contour

`C`

uniformly.

Even though `csreigs`

may not be accurate, it still can give the user some idea how many eigenvalues in a region where the resolution of disk theorem is bad. For example, standard 3-point stencil of finite difference of Laplacian operator is a tridiagonal matrix, and disk theorem would show “all eigenvalues are in the interval [0, 4*N^2]” where N is number of grids. In this case, `csreigs`

is useful for any interval inside [0, 4*N^2].

Remark 1: if `A`

is symmetric in real or Hermitian in complex, all eigenvalues are real. The user still needs to specify a box, not an interval. The height of the box can be much smaller than the width.

Remark 2: only CPU (Host) path is provided.

This function implements Symmetric Reverse Cuthill-McKee permutation. It returns a permutation vector `p`

such that `A(p,p)`

would concentrate nonzeros to diagonal. This is equivalent to `symrcm`

in MATLAB, however the result may not be the same because of different heuristics in the pseudoperipheral finder. The `cuSolverSP`

library implements `symrcm`

based on the following two papers:


E. Cuthill and J. McKee, Reducing the bandwidth of sparse symmetric matrices, ACM ‘69 Proceedings of the 1969 24th national conference, Pages 157-172

Given a left permutation vector `p`

which corresponds to permutation matrix `P`

and a right permutation vector `q`

which corresponds to permutation matrix `Q`

, this function computes permutation of matrix `A`

by

`A`

is an \(m \times n\) sparse matrix that is defined in CSR storage format by the three arrays `csrValA`

, `csrRowPtrA`

and `csrColIndA`

.

The operation is in-place, i.e. the matrix `A`

is overwritten by `B`

.

The permutation vector `p`

and `q`

are base 0. `p`

performs row permutation while `q`

performs column permutation. One can also use MATLAB command \(B = {A(p,q)}\) to permutate matrix `A`

.

This function only computes sparsity pattern of `B`

. The user can use parameter `map`

to get `csrValB`

as well. The parameter `map`

is an input/output. If the user sets `map=0:1:(nnzA-1)`

before calling `csrperm`

, `csrValB=csrValA(map)`

.

The supported matrix type is `CUSPARSE_MATRIX_TYPE_GENERAL`

. If `A`

is symmetric and only lower/upper part is provided, the user has to pass \(A + A^{T}\) into this function.

This function requires a buffer size returned by `csrperm_bufferSize()`

. The address of `pBuffer`

must be a multiple of 128 bytes. If it is not, `CUSOLVER_STATUS_INVALID_VALUE`

is returned.

For example, if matrix `A`

is

and left permutation vector `p=(0,2,1)`

, right permutation vector `q=(2,1,0)`

, then \(P*A*Q^{T}\) is

Remark 1: only CPU (Host) path is provided.

Remark 2: the user can combine `csrsymrcm`

and `csrperm`

to get \(P*A*P^{T}\) which has less zero fill-in during QR factorization.

The batched sparse QR factorization is used to solve either a set of least-squares problems

or a set of linear systems

where each \(A_{j}\) is an \(m \times n\) sparse matrix that is defined in CSR storage format by the four arrays `csrValA`

, `csrRowPtrA`

and `csrColIndA`

.

The supported matrix type is `CUSPARSE_MATRIX_TYPE_GENERAL`

. If `A`

is symmetric and only lower/upper part is provided, the user has to pass \(A + A^{H}\) into this function.

The prerequisite to use batched sparse QR has two-folds. First all matrices \(A_{j}\) must have the same sparsity pattern. Second, no column pivoting is used in least-square problem, so the solution is valid only if \(A_{j}\) is of full rank for all `j = 1,2,..., batchSize`

. All matrices have the same sparsity pattern, so only one copy of `csrRowPtrA`

and `csrColIndA`

is used. But the array `csrValA`

stores coefficients of \(A_{j}\) one after another. In other words, `csrValA[k*nnzA : (k+1)*nnzA]`

is the value of \(A_{k}\) .

The batched QR uses opaque data structure `csrqrInfo`

to keep intermediate data, for example, matrix `Q`

and matrix `R`

of QR factorization. The user needs to create `csrqrInfo`

first by `cusolverSpCreateCsrqrInfo`

before any function in batched QR operation. The `csrqrInfo`

would not release internal data until `cusolverSpDestroyCsrqrInfo`

is called.

There are three routines in batched sparse QR, `cusolverSpXcsrqrAnalysisBatched`

, `cusolverSp[S|D|C|Z]csrqrBufferInfoBatched`

and `cusolverSp[S|D|C|Z]csrqrsvBatched`

.

First, `cusolverSpXcsrqrAnalysisBatched`

is the analysis phase, used to analyze sparsity pattern of matrix `Q`

and matrix `R`

of QR factorization. Also parallelism is extracted during analysis phase. Once analysis phase is done, the size of working space to perform QR is known. However `cusolverSpXcsrqrAnalysisBatched`

uses CPU to analyze the structure of matrix `A`

, and this may consume a lot of memory. If host memory is not sufficient to finish the analysis, `CUSOLVER_STATUS_ALLOC_FAILED`

is returned. The required memory for analysis is proportional to zero fill-in in QR factorization. The user may need to perform some kind of reordering to minimize zero fill-in, for example, `colamd`

or `symrcm`

in MATLAB. `cuSolverSP`

library provides `symrcm`

(`cusolverSpXcsrsymrcm`

).

Second, the user needs to choose proper `batchSize`

and to prepare working space for sparse QR. There are two memory blocks used in batched sparse QR. One is internal memory block used to store matrix `Q`

and matrix `R`

. The other is working space used to perform numerical factorization. The size of the former is proportional to `batchSize`

, and the size is specified by returned parameter `internalDataInBytes`

of `cusolverSp[S|D|C|Z]csrqrBufferInfoBatched`

. while the size of the latter is almost independent of `batchSize`

, and the size is specified by returned parameter `workspaceInBytes`

of `cusolverSp[S|D|C|Z]csrqrBufferInfoBatched`

. The internal memory block is allocated implicitly during first call of `cusolverSp[S|D|C|Z]csrqrsvBatched`

. The user only needs to allocate working space for `cusolverSp[S|D|C|Z]csrqrsvBatched`

.

Instead of trying all batched matrices, the user can find maximum `batchSize`

by querying `cusolverSp[S|D|C|Z]csrqrBufferInfoBatched`

. For example, the user can increase `batchSize`

till summation of `internalDataInBytes`

and `workspaceInBytes`

is greater than size of available device memory.

Suppose that the user needs to perform 253 linear solvers and available device memory is 2GB. if `cusolverSp[S|D|C|Z]csrqrsvBatched`

can only afford `batchSize`

100, the user has to call `cusolverSp[S|D|C|Z]csrqrsvBatched`

three times to finish all. The user calls `cusolverSp[S|D|C|Z]csrqrBufferInfoBatched`

with `batchSize`

100. The opaque `info`

would remember this `batchSize`

and any subsequent call of `cusolverSp[S|D|C|Z]csrqrsvBatched`

cannot exceed this value. In this example, the first two calls of `cusolverSp[S|D|C|Z]csrqrsvBatched`

will use `batchSize`

100, and last call of `cusolverSp[S|D|C|Z]csrqrsvBatched`

will use `batchSize`

53.

Example: suppose that A0, A1, .., A9 have the same sparsity pattern, the following code solves 10 linear systems \(A_{j}x_{j} = b_{j}{,\ j\ =\ 0,2,...,\ 9}\) by batched sparse QR.

```
// Suppose that A0, A1, .., A9 are m x m sparse matrix represented by CSR format,
// Each matrix Aj has nonzero nnzA, and shares the same csrRowPtrA and csrColIndA.
// csrValA is aggregation of A0, A1, ..., A9.
int m ; // number of rows and columns of each Aj
int nnzA ; // number of nonzeros of each Aj

csrqrInfo_t info = NULL;
cusparseMatDescr_t descrA = NULL;
void *pBuffer = NULL; // working space for numerical factorization
// step 1: create a descriptor
cusparseCreateMatDescr(&descrA);
cusparseSetMatIndexBase(descrA, CUSPARSE_INDEX_BASE_ONE); // A is base-1
cusparseSetMatType(descrA, CUSPARSE_MATRIX_TYPE_GENERAL); // A is a general matrix
// step 2: create empty info structure
cusolverSpCreateCsrqrInfo(&info);
// step 3: symbolic analysis
cusolverSpXcsrqrAnalysisBatched(
handle, m, m, nnzA,
descrA, csrRowPtrA, csrColIndA, info);
```

```
// step 4: allocate working space for Aj*xj=bj
cusolverSpDcsrqrBufferInfoBatched(
handle, m, m, nnzA,
descrA,
csrValA, csrRowPtrA, csrColIndA,
batchSize,
info,

/* Output */
cusolverRfHandle_t handle);
```

This routine assembles the internal data structures of the cuSolverRF library for batched operation. It is called after the call to the `cusolverRfCreate()`

routine, and before any other batched routines.

The batched operation assumes that the user has the following linear systems:

where each matrix in the set: \(\{ A_{j}\}\) has the same sparsity pattern, and quite similar such that factorization can be done by the same permutation `P`

and `Q`

. In other words, \(A_{j}{,\ j>1}\) is a small perturbation of \(A_{1}\) .

This routine accepts as input (on the host) the original matrix `A`

(sparsity pattern and batched values), the lower `(L)`

and upper `(U)`

triangular factors, as well as the left `(P)`

and the right `(Q)`

permutations resulting from the full LU factorization of the first `(i=1)`

linear system:

The permutations `P`

and `Q`

represent the final composition of all the left and right reorderings applied to the original matrix `A`

, respectively. However, these permutations are often associated with partial pivoting and reordering to minimize fill-in, respectively.

Remark 1: the matrices `A`

, `L`

and `U`

must be CSR format and base-0.

Remark 2: to get best performance, `batchSize`

should be multiple of 32 and greater or equal to 32. The algorithm is memory-bound, once bandwidth limit is reached, there is no room to improve performance by large `batchSize`

. In practice, `batchSize`

of 32 - 128 is often enough to obtain good performance, but in some cases larger `batchSize`

might be beneficial.

The following routine needs to be called only once for a single linear system:

|
|
|
|
|---|---|---|---|
|
|
|

|
|
|

```

To solve \(A_{j}*x_{j} = b_{j}\) , first we reform the equation by \(M_{j}*Q*x_{j} = P*b_{j}\) where \(M_{j} = P*A_{j}*Q^{T}\) . Then do refactorization \(M_{j} = L_{j}*U_{j}\) by `cusolverRfBatch_Refactor()`

. Further `cusolverRfBatch_Solve()`

takes over the remaining steps, including:

\(z_{j} = P*b_{j}\)

\(M_{j}*y_{j} = z_{j}\)

\(x_{j} = Q^{T}*y_{j}\)

The input parameter `XF_array`

is an array of pointers on device memory. `XF_array(j)`

points to matrix \(x_{j}\) which is also on device memory.

Remark 1: only a single rhs is supported.

Remark 2: no singularity is reported during backward solve. If some matrix \(A_{j}\) failed the refactorization and \(U_{j}\) has some zero diagonal, backward solve would compute NAN. The user has to call `cusolverRfBatch_Zero_Pivot`

to check if refactorization is successful or not.

Although \(A_{j}\) is close to each other, it does not mean \(M_{j} = P*A_{j}*Q^{T} = L_{j}*U_{j}\) exists for every j. The user can query which matrix failed LU refactorization by checking corresponding value in `position`

array. The input parameter `position`

is an integer array of size `batchSize`

.

The `j-th`

component denotes the refactorization result of matrix \(A_{j}\) . If `position(j)`

is -1, the LU refactorization of matrix \(A_{j}\) is successful. If `position(j)`

is `k >= 0`

, matrix \(A_{j}\) is not LU factorizable and its matrix \(U_{j}{(j,j)}\) is zero.

The return value of `cusolverRfBatch_Zero_Pivot`

is `CUSOLVER_STATUS_ZERO_PIVOT`

3. Using the CUSOLVERMG API[](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-the-cusolvermg-api)

Note

cuSolverMG is deprecated. Users are encouraged to use [cuSOLVERMp](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusolvermp/) for multi-GPU functionality, both single- and multi-node.

##
3.1. General Description[](https://docs.nvidia.com#mg-api-intro)

This section describes how to use the cuSolverMG library API. It is not a reference for the cuSolverMG API data types and functions; that is provided in subsequent chapters.

###
3.1.1. Thread Safety[](https://docs.nvidia.com#mg-thread-safety)

The library is thread-safe only if there is one cuSolverMG context per thread.

###
3.1.2. Determinism[](https://docs.nvidia.com#determinism)

Currently all cuSolverMG API routines from a given toolkit version generate the same bit-wise results when the following conditions are respected:

all GPUs participating to the computation have the same compute-capabilities and the same number of SMs.

the tiles size is kept the same between run.

number of logical GPUs is kept the same. The order of GPUs are not important because all have the same compute-capabilities.


###
3.1.3. Tile Strategy[](https://docs.nvidia.com#tile-strategy)

The tiling strategy of cuSolverMG is compatible with ScaLAPACK. The current release only supports 1-D column block cyclic, column-major PACKED format.

Figure 1.a shows a partition of the matrix A of dimension `M_A`

by `N_A`

. Each column tile has `T_A`

columns. There are seven columns of tiles, labeled as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, distributed into three GPUs in a `cyclic`

way, i.e. each GPU takes one column tile in turn. For example, GPU 0 has column tile 0, 3, 6 (yellow tiles) and GPU 1 takes column tiles next to GPU 0 (blue tiles). Not all GPUs have the same number of tiles; in this example, GPU 0 has three tiles, others have only two tiles.

Figure 1.b shows two possible formats to store those column tiles locally in each GPU. Left side is called PACKED format and right side is UNPACKED format. PACKED format aggregates three column tiles in a contiguous memory block while UNPACKED format distributes these three column tiles into different memory blocks. The only difference between them is that PACKED format can have a big GEMM call instead of three GEMM calls in UNPACKED format. So theoretically speaking, PACKED format can deliver better performance than UNPACKED format. `cuSolverMG`

only supports PACKED format in the API. In order to achieve maximal performance, the user just needs to choose the proper tile size `T_A`

to partition the matrix, not too small, for example 256 or above is enough.

There is another parameter, called `LLD_A`

, to control the leading dimension of the local matrix in each GPU. `LLD_A`

must be greater or equal to `M_A`

. The purpose of `LLD_A`

is for better performance of GEMM. For small problems, GEMM is faster if `LLD_A`

is power of 2. However for big problems, `LLD_A`

does not show significant improvement. `cuSolverMG`

only supports `LLD_A=M_A`

.

The processing grid in `cuSolverMG`

is a list of GPU IDs, similar to the process ID in `ScaLAPACK`

. `cuSolverMG`

only supports 1D column block cyclic, so only 1D grid is supported as well. Suppose `deviceId`

is a list of GPU IDs, both `deviceId=1,1,1`

and `deviceId=2,1,0`

are valid. The former describes three logical devices that are selected to run `cuSolverMG`

routines, and all have the same physical ID, 0. The latter still uses three logical devices, but each has a different physical ID. The current design only accepts 32 logical devices, that is, the length of `deviceId`

is less or equal to 32. Figure 1 uses `deviceId=0,1,2`

.

In practice, the matrix A is distributed into GPUs listed in `deviceId`

. If the user chooses `deviceId=1,1,1`

, all columns tile are located in GPU 1, this will limit the size of the problem because of memory capacity of one GPU. Besides, multiGPU routine adds extra overhead on data communication through the off-chip bus, which has a big performance impact if NVLINK is not supported or used. It would be faster to run on a single GPU instead of running multiGPU version with devices of the same GPU ID.

###
3.1.4. Global Matrix Versus Local Matrix[](https://docs.nvidia.com#global-matrix-versus-local-matrix)

Operating a submatrix of the matrix A is simple in dense linear algebra, just shift the pointer to the starting point of the submatrix relative to A. For example, `gesvd(10,10, A)`

is SVD of `A(0:9,0:9)`

. `gesvd(10,10, A + 5 + 2*lda )`

is SVD of 10-by-10 submatrix starting at `A(5,2)`

.

However it is not simple to operate on a submatrix of a distributed matrix because different starting point of the submatrix changes the distribution of the layout of that submatrix. `ScaLAPACK`

introduces two parameters, `IA`

and `JA`

, to locate the submatrix. Figure 2 shows (global) matrix A of dimension `M_A`

by `N_A`

. The `sub(A)`

is a `M`

by `N`

submatrix of A, starting at `IA`

and `JA`

. Please be aware that `IA`

and `JA`

are base-1.

Given a distributed matrix `A`

, the user can compute eigenvalues of the submatrix `sub(A)`

by either calling `syevd(A, IA, JA)`

or gathering `sub(A)`

to another distributed matrix `B`

and calling `syevd(B, IB=1, JB=1)`

.

###
3.1.5. Usage of _bufferSize[](https://docs.nvidia.com#mg-buffersize)

There is no cudaMalloc inside `cuSolverMG`

library, so the user must allocate the device workspace explicitly. The routine `xyz_bufferSize`

is to query the size of workspace of the routine `xyz`

, for example `xyz = syevd`

. To make the API simple, `xyz_bufferSize`

follows almost the same signature of `xyz`

even it only depends on some parameters, for example, the device pointer is not used to decide the size of workspace. In most cases, `xyz_bufferSize`

is called in the beginning before actual device data (pointing by a device pointer) is prepared or before the device pointer is allocated. In such cases, the user can pass a null pointer to `xyz_bufferSize`

without breaking the functionality.

`xyz_bufferSize`

returns bufferSize for each device. The size is number of elements, not number of bytes.

###
3.1.6. Synchronization[](https://docs.nvidia.com#synchronization)

All routines are in synchronous (blocking call) manner. The data is ready after the routine. However the user has to prepare the distributed data before calling the routine. For example, if the user has multiple streams to set up the matrix, stream synchronization or device synchronization is necessary to guarantee the distributed matrix is ready.

###
3.1.7. Context Switch[](https://docs.nvidia.com#context-switch)

The user does not need to restore the device by `cudaSetDevice()`

after each cuSolverMG call. All routines set the device back to what the caller has.

###
3.1.8. NVLINK[](https://docs.nvidia.com#nvlink)

The peer-to-peer communication via NVLINK can dramatically reduce the overhead of data exchange among GPUs. `cuSolverMG`

does not enable NVLINK implicitly, instead, it gives this option back to the user, not to interfere with other libraries. The example code H.1 shows how to enable peer-to-peer communication.

##
3.2. cuSolverMG Types Reference[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolvermg-types-reference)

###
3.2.1. cuSolverMG Types[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolvermg-types)

The `float`

, `double`

, `cuComplex`

, and `cuDoubleComplex`

data types are supported. The first two are standard C data types, while the last two are exported from `cuComplex.h`

. In addition, cuSolverMG uses some familiar types from cuBLAS.

###
3.2.2. cusolverMgHandle_t[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cusolvermghandle-t)

This is a pointer type to an opaque cuSolverMG context, which the user must initialize by calling `cusolverMgCreate()`

prior to calling any other library function. An un-initialized handle object will lead to unexpected behavior, including crashes of cuSolverMG. The handle created and returned by `cusolverMgCreate()`

must be passed to every cuSolverMG function.

means repeated device ID are permitted. For example, suppose the user has only one GPU in the system, say device 0. If the user sets `deviceId=0,0,0`

, then `cuSolverMG`

treats them as three independent GPUs, one stream each, so concurrent kernel launches still hold. The current design only supports up to 32 logical devices.

This function solves a system of linear equations:

where `A`

is an \(n \times n\) Hermitian matrix, only lower or upper part is meaningful using the generic API interface. The input parameter `uplo`

indicates which part of the matrix is used. The function would leave other parts untouched.

If input parameter `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_LOWER`

, the matrix should `A`

contain the lower triangular factor for Cholesky decomposition previously computed by `cusolverMgPotrf`

routine.

If input parameter `uplo`

is `CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_UPPER`

, the matrix should `A`

contain the upper triangular factor for Cholesky decomposition previously computed by the `cusolverMgPotrf`

routine.

The operation is in-place, i.e. matrix `B`

contains the solution of the linear system on exit.

If output parameter `info = -i`

(less than zero), the `i-th`

parameter is wrong (not counting handle).

The user has to provide device working space in `array_d_work`

This function computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric (Hermitian) \(N \times N\) matrix `A`

. The standard symmetric eigenvalue problem is:

where `Λ`

is a real \(N \times N\) diagonal matrix. `V`

is an \(N \times N\) unitary matrix. The diagonal elements of `Λ`

are the eigenvalues of `A`

in ascending order.

`cusolverMgSyevd`

returns the eigenvalues in `W`

and overwrites the eigenvectors in `A`

. `W`

is a host \(1 \times N\) vector.

The generic API has three different types, `dataTypeA`

is data type of the matrix `A`

, `dataTypeW`

is data type of the vector `W`

, and `computeType`

is compute type of the operation and data type of the workspace (`array_d_work`

) `descrA`

contains `dataTypeA`
