# 1. GDS cuFile API Reference[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gds-cufile-api-reference)

The NVIDIA® GPUDirect® Storage (GDS) cuFile API Reference Guide provides information about the cuFile API reference that is used in applications and frameworks to leverage GDS technology and describes the intent, context, and operation of those APIs, which are part of the GDS technology.

# 2. Introduction[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#introduction)

NVIDIA® Magnum IO GPUDirect® Storage (GDS) is part of the GPUDirect family. GDS enables a direct data path for direct memory access (DMA) transfers between GPU memory and storage, which avoids a bounce buffer through the CPU. This direct path increases system bandwidth and decreases the latency and utilization load on the CPU.

This document provides information about the cuFile APIs that are used in applications and frameworks to leverage GDS technology and describes the intent, context, and operation of those APIs which are part of the GDS technology.

Note

The APIs and descriptions are subject to change without notice.

# 3. Usage[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#usage)

This section describes the operation of the cuFile APIs.

Because the functionality is part of the CUDA Driver C API, the APIs use the `cuFile`

prefix and camel case motif of the CUDA Driver.

All APIs are thread-safe.

The fork system call should not be used after the library is initialized. The behavior of the APIs after the fork system call is undefined in the child process.

The APIs with GPU buffers should be called in a valid CUDA context and stream if applicable.

All APIs are issued from the CPU, not the GPU.


Note

Starting from CUDA toolkit 12.2 (GDS version 1.7.x) release cuFile APIs support memory allocated on GPU device as well as host memory. peer to peer transfer using GPUDirect is supported to and from device memory on supported file system and hardware configurations. The APIs will refer to this memory address as buffer pointer unless the API specifically applies to a particular type of memory.

## 3.1. Dynamic Interactions[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#dynamic-interactions)

The following describes the dynamic interactions between the cuFile APIs.

Some of the cuFile APIs are optional. If they are not called proactively, their actions will occur reactively:

If ```
cuFile{DriverOpen, HandleRegister, BufRegister} `` is called on a driver, file, or buffer, respectively that has been
opened or registered by a previous ``cuFile
```

* API call, this will result in an error. Calling `cuFile{BufDeregister, HandleDeregister, DriverClose}`

on a buffer, file, or driver, respectively that has never been opened or registered by a previous `cuFile`

* API
call results in an error. For these errors, the output parameters of the APIs are left in an undefined state,
and there are no other side effects.

`cuFileDriverOpen`

explicitly causes driver initialization.Its use is optional. If it is not used, driver initialization happens implicitly at the first use of the

`cuFile{HandleRegister, Read, Write, BufRegister}`

APIs.(Mandatory)

`cuFileHandleRegister`

turns an OS-specific file descriptor into a`CUfileHandle_t`

and performs checking on the GDS supportability based on the mount point and the way that the file was opened.`cuFileBufRegister`

explicitly registers a memory buffer.If this API is not called, an internal registered memory is used if required on the first time the buffer is used, for example, in

`cuFile{Read, Write}`

.`cuFile{BufDeregister, HandleDeregister}`

explicitly frees a buffer and file resources, respectively.If this API is not called, the buffer and resources are implicitly freed when the driver is closed using

`cuFileDriverClose`

.`cuFileDriverClose`

explicitly frees driver resources.If this API is not called, the driver resources are implicitly freed when

`dlclose()`

is performed on the library handle or when the process is terminated.

## 3.2. Driver, File, and Buffer Management[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#driver-file-and-buffer-management)

This section describes the overall workflow to manage the driver, the file, and buffer management:

Call

`cuFileDriverOpen()`

to initialize the state of the critical performance path.Allocate GPU memory with cudaMalloc,

`cudaMallocManaged`

,`cuMem*`

APIs or host memory using`cudaMallocHost`

,`malloc`

or`mmap`

.To register the buffer, call

`cuFileBufRegister`

to initialize the buffer state of the critical performance path.Complete the following IO workflow:

For Linux, open a file with POSIX open.

Call

`cuFileHandleRegister`

to wrap an existing file descriptor in an OS-agnostic`CUfileHandle_t`

. This step evaluates the suitability of the file state and the file mount for GDS and initializes the file state of the critical performance path.Call IO APIs such as

`cuFileRead`

/`cuFileWrite`

on an existing cuFile handle and existing buffer.If the

`cuFileBufRegister`

has not been previously called on the buffer pointer,`cuFileRead/cuFileWrite`

will use internal registered buffers when required.Not using cuFileBufRegister might not be performant for small IO sizes.

Refer to the

[GPUDirect Best Practices Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/gpudirect-storage/best-practices-guide/index.html)for more information.

Unless an error condition is returned, the IO is performed successfully.


Call

`cuFileBufDeregister`

to free the buffer-specific cuFile state.Call

`cuFileHandleDeregister`

to free the file-specific cuFile state.Call

`cuFileDriverClose`

to free up the cuFile state.

Note

Not using the `cuFileDeregister`

and `cuFileDriverClose`

APIs (steps 5, 6, and 7) might unnecessarily consume
resources, as shown by tools such as valgrind. The best practice is to always call these APIs in the application cleanup paths.

## 3.3. cuFile Compatibility Mode[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-compatibility-mode)

**Use Cases**

cuFile APIs can be used in different scenarios:

Developers building GPUDirect Storage applications with cuFile APIs, but don’t have the supported hardware configurations.

Developers building applications running on GPU cards that have CUDA compute capability > 6, but don’t have BAR space exposed.

Deployments where

`nvidia-fs.ko`

is not loaded or cannot be loaded.Deployments where the Linux distribution does not support GPUDirect Storage.

Deployments where the filesystem may be not supported with GPUDirect Storage.

Deployments where the network links are not enabled with RDMA support.

Deployment where the configuration is not optimal for GPUDirect Storage.


**Behavior**

The cuFile library provides a mechanism for cuFile reads and writes to use compatibility mode using POSIX `pread`

,
`pwrite`

, and `aio_submit`

APIS respectively to host memory and copying to GPU memory when applicable. The behavior
of compatibility mode with cuFile APIs is determined by the following configuration parameters.

Configuration Option (default) |
cuFile IO Behavior |
|---|---|
“allow_compat_mode”: true |
If |
“force_compat_mode”: false |
If |
“gds_rdma_write_support”: true |
If |
“posix_unaligned_writes” : false |
If |
“lustre:posix_gds_min_kb” : 0 |
For a lustre filesystem, if greater than
|
“weka:rdma_write_support” : false |
If this option is
|
“gpfs:gds_write_support” : false |
If this option is false, all writes to IBM Spectrum Scale will use compatibility mode.
|
“rdma_dynamic_routing”: false, “rdma_dynamic_routing_order”: [ “ “SYS_MEM” ] |
If |

In addition to the above configuration options, compatibility mode will be used as a fallback option for following use cases.

Use Case |
cuFile IO Behavior |
|---|---|
No BAR1 memory in GPU. |
Use compatibility mode. |
For wekaFS or IBM Spectrum Scale mounts: If there are no |
Use compatibility mode. |
Bounce buffers cannot be allocated in GPU memory. |
Use compatibility mode. |
For WekaFS and IBM Spectrum Scale: If the kernel returns |
Retry the IO operation internally using compatibility mode. |
cuFile Stream and cuFile Batch APIs on IBM Spectrum Scale or WekaFS |
All Async and batch operations will internally use compatibility mode IO. |
The |
All IO operations will use compatibility mode. |

**Limitations**

Compatible mode does not work in cases where the GPUs have CUDA compute capability less than 6.

GDS Compat mode has been tested and works with GDS enabled file systems and environments. It has not been tested to work on all other filesystems.

## 4.2. cuFile Driver APIs[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-driver-apis)

The following cuFile APIs that are used to initialize, finalize, query, and tune settings for the cuFile system.

```
/* Initialize the cuFile infrastructure */
CUfileError_t cuFileDriverOpen();
/* Finalize the cuFile system */
CUfileError_t cuFileDriverClose();
/* Query capabilities based on current versions, installed functionality */
CUfileError_t cuFileGetDriverProperties(CUfileDrvProps_t *props);
/*API to set whether the Read/Write APIs use polling to do IO operations */
CUfileError_t cuFileDriverSetPollMode(bool poll, size_t poll_threshold_size);
/*API to set max IO size(KB) used by the library to talk to nvidia-fs driver */
CUfileError_t cuFileDriverSetMaxDirectIOSize(size_t max_direct_io_size);
/* API to set maximum GPU memory reserved per device by the library for internal buffering */
CUfileError_t cuFileDriverSetMaxCacheSize(size_t max_cache_size);
/* Sets maximum buffer space that is pinned in KB for use by cuFileBufRegister
CUfileError_t cuFileDriverSetMaxPinnedMemSize(size_t
max_pinned_memory_size);
/* Retrieves the cuFile library version. */
CUfileError_t cuFileGetVersion(int *version);
```

Note

Refer to the [error_and_properties.cc](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MagnumIO/blob/main/gds/samples/1_cuFile_Basics/error_and_properties.cc) sample for usage.

## 4.3. cuFile Synchronous IO APIs[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-synchronous-io-apis)

The core of the cuFile IO APIs are the read and write functions.

```
ssize_t cuFileRead(CUFileHandle_t fh, void *bufPtr_base, size_t size, off_t file_offset, off_t devPtr_offset);
ssize_t cuFileWrite(CUFileHandle_t fh, const void *bufPtr_base, size_t size, off_t file_offset, off_t devPtr_offset);
```

The starting offset of the buffer on the device or host is determined by a base (`bufPtr_base`

) and offset
(`bufPtr_offset`

). This offset is distinct from the offset in the file.

Note

To use the registered buffer, the bufPtr_base must be the buffer pointer used to register during `cuFileBufRegister`

.
Otherwise `cuFileRead`

and `cuFileWrite`

APIs may use internal memory buffers for GPUDirect Storage peer to peer operations.

Note

The default behavior for all paths where GDS is not supported is for the cuFile IO API to attempt IO using file
system supported posix mode APIs when `properties.allow_compat_mode`

is set to true. In order to disable cuFile
APIs falling back to posix APIs for unsupported GDS paths, `properties.allow_compat_mode`

in the `/etc/cufile.json`

file should be set to false.

Note

Refer to the [runtime_rw_integrity.cc](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MagnumIO/blob/main/gds/samples/1_cuFile_Basics/runtime_rw_integrity.cc) sample for usage.

## 4.4. cuFile File Handle APIs[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-file-handle-apis)

Here is some information about the cuFile Handle APIs.

The `cuFileHandleRegister`

API makes a file descriptor or handle that is known to the cuFile subsystem by using an
OS-agnostic interface. The API returns an opaque handle that is owned by the cuFile subsystem.

To conserve memory, the `cuFileHandleDeregister`

API is used to release cuFile-related memory objects. Using only
the POSIX close will not clean up resources that were used by cuFile. Additionally, the clean up of cuFile objects
associated with the files that were operated on in the cuFile context will occur at `cuFileDriverClose`

.

```
CUfileError_t cuFileHandleRegister(CUFileHandle_t *fh, CUFileDescr_t *descr);
void cuFileHandleDeregister(CUFileHandle_t fh);
```

Note

Refer to the [runtime_rw_integrity.cc](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MagnumIO/blob/main/gds/samples/1_cuFile_Basics/runtime_rw_integrity.cc) sample for usage.

## 4.5. cuFile Buffer APIs[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-buffer-apis)

The `cuFileBufRegister`

API incurs a significant performance cost, so registration costs should be amortized
where possible. Developers must ensure that buffers are registered up front and off the critical path.

The `cuFileBufRegister`

API is optional. If this is not used, instead of pinning the user’s memory, cuFile-managed
and internally pinned buffers are used.

The `cuFileBufDeregister`

API is used to optimally clean up cuFile-related memory objects, but CUDA currently
has no analog to `cuFileBufDeregister`

. The cleaning up of objects associated with the buffers operated on in
the cuFile context occurs at `cuFileDriverClose`

. If explicit APIs are used, the incurred errors are reported
immediately, but if the operations of these explicit APIs are performed implicitly, error reporting and handling
are less clear.

```
CUfileError_t cuFileBufRegister(const void *devPtr_base, size_t size, int flags);
CUfileError_t cuFileBufDeregister(const void *devPtr_base);
```

Note

Refer to the [devmem_offset_write.cc](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MagnumIO/blob/main/gds/samples/1_cuFile_Basics/devmem_offset_write.cc) sample for usage.

## 4.6. cuFile Stream APIs[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-stream-apis)

Operations that are enqueued with cuFile Stream APIs are FIFO ordered with respect to other work on the stream and must be completed before continuing with the next action in the stream.

```
CUfileError_t cuFileReadAsync(CUFileHandle_t fh, void *bufPtr_base,
size_t *size_p, off_t *file_offset_p, off_t *bufPtr_offset_p,
ssize_t *bytes_read_p, CUStream stream);
CUfileError_t cuFileWriteAsync(CUFileHandle_t fh, void *bufPtr_base,
size_t *size_p, off_t *file_offset_p, off_t *bufPtr_offse_pt,
ssize_t *bytes_written_p, CUstream stream);
```

Note

Refer to the samples in [4_cuFile_Async](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MagnumIO/tree/main/gds/samples/4_cuFile_Async) for usage.

## 4.7. cuFile Batch APIs[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-batch-apis)

Batch APIs are submitted synchronously, but executed asynchronously with respect to host thread.

These operations can be submitted on different files, different locations in the same file, or a mix.
Completion of IO can be checked asynchronously using a status API in the same host thread or in a
different thread. The `cuFileBatchIOGetStatus`

API takes an array of `CUfileIOEvents_t`

and
minimum number of elements to poll for, which describes the IO action, status, errors, and bytes
transacted for each instance. The bytes transacted field is valid only when the status indicates a
successful completion. For any batch I/O size bigger than the bounce buffer size (`properties.per_buffer_cache_size_kb`

),
cuFile uses compatible mode.

Note

Refer to the samples in [3_cuFile_Batch](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MagnumIO/tree/main/gds/samples/3_cuFile_Batch) for usage.

# 5. cuFile API Functional Specification[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-api-functional-specification)

This section provides information about the cuFile API functional specification.

See the [GPUDirect Storage Overview Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/gpudirect-storage/overview-guide/index.html)
for a high-level analysis of the set of functions and their relation to each other. We anticipate adding additional
return codes for some of these functions.

All cuFile APIs are called from the host code.

## 5.1. cuFileDriver API Functional Specification[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufiledriver-api-functional-specification)

This section provides information about the cuFileDriver API functional specification.

### 5.1.1. cuFileDriverOpen[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufiledriveropen)

```
CUfileError_t cuFileDriverOpen();
```

Opens the Driver session to support GDS IO operations.

**Parameters**

None

**Returns**

`CU_FILE_SUCCESS`

on a successful open, or if the driver is already open.`CU_FILE_DRIVER_NOT_INITIALIZED`

on a failure to open the driver.`CU_FILE_PERMISSION_DENIED`

on a failure to open.This can happen when the character device (

`/dev/nvidia_fs[0-15]`

) is restricted to certain users by an administrator, for example, admin, where`/dev`

is not exposed with read permissions in the container.`CU_FILE_DRIVER_VERSION_MISMATCH`

, when there is a mismatch between the cuFile library and its kernel driver.`CU_FILE_CUDA_DRIVER_ERROR`

if the CUDA driver failed to initialize.`CU_FILE_PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED`

if the current platform is not supported by GDS.`CU_FILE_NVFS_SETUP_ERROR`

for a cuFile-specific internal error.

Refer to the `cufile.log`

file for more information.

**Description**

This API opens the session with the NVFS kernel driver to communicate from userspace to kernel space and calls the GDS driver to set up the resources required to support GDS IO operations.

The API checks whether the current platform supports GDS and initializes the cuFile library.

This API loads the cuFile settings from a JSON configuration file in

`/etc/cufile.JSON`

.If the JSON configuration file does not exist, the API loads the default library settings. To modify this default config file, administrative privileges are needed. The administrator can modify it to grant cuFile access to the specified devices and mount paths and also tune IO parameters (in KB, 4K aligned) that are based on the type of workload. Refer to the

[default config file](https://docs.nvidia.com/gpudirect-storage/configuration-guide/index.html#gds-parameters)(`/etc/cufile.json`

) for more information.

### 5.1.2. cuFileDriverClose[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufiledriverclose)

```
CUfileError_t cuFileDriverClose();
```

Closes the driver session and frees any associated resources for GDS.

This happens implicitly upon process exit.

The driver can be reopened once it is closed.


**Parameters**

None

**Returns**

`CU_FILE_SUCCESS`

on a successful close.`CU_FILE_DRIVER_NOT_INITIALIZED`

on failure.

**Description**

Close the GDS session and any associated memory resources. If there are buffers registered by using

`cuFileBufRegister`

, which are not unregistered, a`cuFileDriverClose`

implicitly unregisters those buffers. Any in-flight IO when`cuFileDriverClose`

is in-progress will receive an error.

### 5.1.3. cuFileDriverGetProperties[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufiledrivergetproperties)

The `cuFileDrvProps_t`

structure can be queried with `cuFileDriverGetProperties`

and selectively
modified with `cuFileDriverSetProperties`

. The structure is self-describing, and its fields are
consistent with the major and minor API version parameters.

```
CUfileError_t cuFileDriverGetProperties(cuFileDrvProps_t *props);
```

Gets the Driver session properties for GDS functionality.


**Parameters**

`props`


Pointer to the cuFile Driver properties.

This API is used to get the current `nvidia-fs`

drivers-specific properties such as the following:

`major_version`

: the cuFile major version`minor_version`

: the cuFile minor version`props.nvfs.dstatusflags`

, which are bit flags that indicate support for the following driver features:`CU_FILE_EXASCALER_SUPPORTED`

, a bit to check whether the DDN EXAScaler parallel filesystem solutions (based on the Lustre filesystem) client supports GDS.`CU_FILE_WEKAFS_SUPPORTED`

, a bit to check whether WekaFS supports GDS.

`Props.nvfs.dcontrolflags`

, which are bit flags that indicate the current activation for driver features:`CU_FILE_USE_POLL_MODE`

, when bit is set, IO uses polling mode.`CU_FILE_ALLOW_COMPAT_MODE`

, if the value is 1 compatible mode is set.

Otherwise, the compatible mode is disabled.

`Props.fflags`

, which are bit flags that indicate whether the following library features are supported:`CU_FILE_STREAMS_SUPPORTED`

, an attribute that checks whether CUDA-streams are supported.`CU_FILE_DYN_ROUTING_SUPPORTED`

, an attribute that checks whether dynamic routing feature is supported.

`Props.nvfs.poll_thresh_size`

, a maximum IO size, in KB and must be 4K-aligned, that is used for the POLLING mode.`Props.nvfs.max_direct_io_size`

```

Sets the max IO size, in KB.

This parameter is used by the nvidia-fs driver as the maximum IO chunk size in which IO is issued to the underlying filesystem. In compatible mode, this is the maximum IO chunk size that the library uses to issue POSIX read/writes.

The max direct IO size must be 4K aligned.


**Parameters**

`max_direct_io_size`


The maximum allowed direct IO size in KB. The default value is 16384KB. This is because typically parallel-file systems perform better with bulk read/writes.

```

Sets the maximum GPU buffer space, in KB, that is pinned and mapped. This value might be rounded down to the nearest GPU page size.

The max pinned size must be 4K aligned.

The default value corresponds to the maximum

`PinnedMemory`

or the physical memory size of the device.This API overrides the default value that may be set by the

`properties.max_device_pinned_mem_size_kb`

JSON config key for the current process.

**Parameters**

`max_pinned_memory_size`


The maximum buffer space, in KB, that is pinned and mapped to the GPU BAR space. This value might be rounded down to the nearest GPU page size. The maximum limit may be set to UINT64_MAX, which is equivalent to no enforced limit. It may be set to something smaller than the size of the GPU’s physical memory.

Currently, based on the platform, only `CU_FILE_P2P_FLAG_PCI_P2PDMA`

or
`CU_FILE_P2P_FLAG_C2C`

is allowed. If these flags are set, then the I/O will
be attempted via P2PDMA mode (if the system supports it) instead of traditional
NVFS mode.

### 5.1.16. cuFileDriverGetP2PFlags[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufiledrivergetp2pflags)

```
CUfileError_t cuFileDriverGetP2PFlags(CUfileDriverStatusFlags_t status_flag,
CUfileP2PFlags_t *p2p_flags)
```

Gets the P2P flags for a specific filesystem or block device.


**Parameters**

`status_flag`


The filesystem/device status flag (for example,

`CU_FILE_LUSTRE_SUPPORTED`

).

`p2p_flags`


Pointer to store the P2P flags.


**Returns**

`CU_FILE_SUCCESS`

on success.`CU_FILE_DRIVER_NOT_INITIALIZED`

if the cuFile driver is not initialized.`CU_FILE_INVALID_VALUE`

if`p2p_flags`

is`NULL`

.

**Description**

This API is used to query what P2P modes are supported by cuFile for a certain filesystem or block device.

## 5.2. cuFile IO API Functional Specification[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-io-api-functional-specification)

This section provides information about the cuFile IO API function specification.

The device pointer addresses referred to in these APIs pertain to the current context for the caller.

Unlike the non-async version of `cuMemcpy`

, the `cuFileHandleRegister`

, `cuFileHandleDeregister`

,
`cuFileRead`

, and `cuFileWrite`

APIs do not have the semantic of being ordered with respect to other
work in the null stream.

### 5.2.1. cuFileHandleRegister[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilehandleregister)

```
CUfileError_t cuFileHandleRegister(CUFileHandle_t *fh, CUfileDescr_t *descr);
```

Register an open file.

`cuFileHandleRegister`

is required and performs extra checking that is memoized to provide increased performance on later cuFile operations.This API is OS agnostic.


Note

CUDA toolkit 12.2 (GDS version 1.7.x) supports non O_DIRECT open flags as well as O_DIRECT. Application is allowed to open a file in non O_DIRECT mode in compat mode and also with nvidia-fs.ko installed. In the latter case, an O_DIRECT path between GPU and Storage will be used if such a path exists.


**Parameters**

`fh`


Valid pointer to the OS-neutral cuFile handle structure supplied by the user but populated and maintained by the cuFile runtime.


`desc`


Valid pointer to the OS-neutral file descriptor supplied by the user carrying details regarding the file to be opened such as

`fd`

for Linux-based files.

**Returns**

`CU_FILE_SUCCESS`

on successful completion.`CU_FILE_DRIVER_NOT_INITIALIZED`

on failure to load the driver.`CU_FILE_IO_NOT_SUPPORTED`

, if the filesystem is not supported.`CU_FILE_INVALID_VALUE`

if there are null or bad API arguments.`CU_FILE_INVALID_FILE_OPEN_FLAG`

, if the file is opened with unsupported modes such as no`O_APPEND`

,`O_NOCTTY`

,`O_NONBLOCK`

,`O_DIRECTORY`

,`O_NOFOLLOW`

,`O_NOATIME`

, and`O_TMPFILE`

.

`CU_FILE_INVALID_FILE_TYPE`

, if the file path is not valid, not a regular file, not a symbolic link, or not a device file.`CU_FILE_HANDLE_ALREADY_REGISTERED`

if the file is already registered using the same file-descriptor.

**Description**

Given a file-descriptor will populate and return the

`CUfileHandle_t`

needed for issuing IO with cuFile APIs.A return value of anything other than CU_FILE_SUCCESS leaves fh in an undefined state but has no other side effects.

By default this API accepts whether the file descriptor is opened with O_DIRECT mode or non O_DIRECT mode.


Refer to the following for more information:

### 5.2.2. cuFileHandleDeregister[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilehandlederegister)

```
CUfileError_t cuFileHandleDeregister(CUFileHandle_t *fh);
```

**Parameters**

`fh`


The file handle obtained from

`cuFileHandleRegister`

.

**Returns**

None

Note

This API only logs an ERROR level message in the `cufile.log`

file for valid inputs.

**Description**

The API is used to release resources that are claimed by

`cuFileHandleRegister`

.This API should be invoked only after the application ensures there are no outstanding IO operations with the handle. If

`cuFileHandleDeregister`

is called while IO on the file is in progress might result in undefined behavior.The user is still expected to close the file descriptor outside the cuFile subsystem after calling this API using

`close`

system call.Closing a file handle without calling

`cuFileHandleDeregister`

does not release the resources that are held in the cuFile library. If this API is not called, the cuFile subsystem releases the resources lazily or when the application exits.

Refer to the following for more information:

### 5.2.3. cuFileRead[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufileread)

```
ssize_t cuFileRead(CUfileHandle_tfh, void *bufPtr_base, size_t size, off_t file_offset, off_t bufPtr_offset);
```

Reads specified bytes from the file descriptor into the device memory or the host memory.


**Parameters**

`fh`


File descriptor for the file.


`bufPtr_base`


Base address of buffer in device memory or host memory. For registered buffers,

`bufPtr_base`

must remain set to the base address used in the`cuFileBufRegister`

call.

`size`


Size in bytes to read.


`file_offset`


Offset in the file to read from.


`bufPtr_offset`


Offset relative to the

`bufPtr_base`

pointer to read into. This parameter should be used only with registered buffers.

**Returns**

Size of bytes that were successfully read.

-1 on an error, so errno is set to indicate filesystem errors.

All other errors return a negative integer value of the

`CUfileOpError`

enum value.

**Description**

This API reads the data from a specified file handle at a specified offset and size bytes into the GPU memory by using GDS functionality or into the host memory based on the type of memory pointer. The API works correctly for unaligned offsets and any data size, although the performance might not match the performance of aligned reads. This is a synchronous call and blocks until the IO is complete.

Note

For the `bufPtr_offset`

, if data will be read starting exactly from the `bufPtr_base`

that is registered
with `cuFileBufRegister`

, `bufPtr_offset`

should be set to 0. To read starting from an offset in the
registered buffer range, the relative offset should be specified in the `bufPtr_offset,`

and the `bufPtr_base`

must remain set to the base address that was used in the `cuFileBufRegister`

call.

See the following for more information:

### 5.2.4. cuFileWrite[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilewrite)

```
ssize_t cuFileWrite(CUfileHandle_t fh, const void *bufPtr_base, size_t size, off_t file_offset, off_t bufPtr_offset);
```

Writes specified bytes from the device memory into the file descriptor using GDS.


**Parameters**

`fh`


File descriptor for the file


`bufPtr_base`


Base address of buffer in device memory or host memory. For registered buffers,

`bufPtr_base`

must remain set to the base address used in the`cuFileBufRegister`

call.

`size`


Size in bytes to which to write.


`file_offset`


Offset in the file to which to write.


`bufPtr_offset`


Offset relative to the

`bufPtr_base`

pointer from which to write. This parameter should be used only with registered buffers.

**Returns**

Size of bytes that were successfully written.

-1 on an error, so errno is set to indicate filesystem errors.

All other errors return a negative integer value of the

`CUfileOpError`

enum value.

**Description**

This API writes the data from the GPU memory or the host memory to a file specified by the file handle at a specified offset and size bytes by using GDS functionality. The API works correctly for unaligned offset and data sizes, although the performance is not on-par with aligned writes.This is a synchronous call and will block until the IO is complete.

Note

GDS functionality modified the standard file system metadata in SysMem. However, GDS functionality
does not take any special responsibility for writing that metadata back to permanent storage. The
data is not guaranteed to be present after a system crash unless the application uses an explicit
`fsync(2)`

call. If the file is opened with an `O_SYNC`

flag, the metadata will be written to
the disk before the call is complete.

Refer to the note in [cuFileRead](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufileread) for more information about `bufPtr_offset:`

.

, for device memory that is not allocated via`cudaMalloc`

or`cuMemAlloc`

.`CU_FILE_CUDA_POINTER_RANGE_ERROR`

, if the size exceeds the bounds of the allocated memory.`CU_FILE_INVALID_MAPPING_SIZE`

, if the size exceeds the GPU resource limits.`CU_FILE_GPU_MEMORY_PINNING_FAILED`

, if not enough pinned memory is available.

**Description**

Based on the memory type, this API either registers the specified GPU address or host memory address and size
for use with the `cuFileRead`

and `cuFileWrite`

operations. The user must call `cuFileBufDeregister`

to
release the pinned memory mappings for GPU memory if needed.

See the following for more information:

was not registered.`CU_FILE_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE`

on failure to find the registration for the specified memory.`CU_FILE_INTERNAL_ERROR`

, an internal library-specific error.

**Description**

This API deregisters memory mappings that were registered by `cuFileBufRegister`

. Refer to [cuFileBufRegister](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilebufregister) for more information.

## 5.4. cuFile Stream API Functional Specification[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-stream-api-functional-specification)

This section provides information about the cuFile stream API functional specification.

The stream APIs are similar to Read and Write, but they take a stream parameter to support asynchronous operations and execute in the CUDA stream order.

## 5.5. cuFile Batch API Functional Specification[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-batch-api-functional-specification)

### 5.5.1. cuFileBatchIOSetUp[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilebatchiosetup)

```
CUfileError_t
cuFileBatchIOSetUp(CUfileBatchHandle_t *batch_idp, int max_nr);
```

**Parameters**

`max_nr`


(Input) The maximum number of events this batch will hold.

Note

The number should be between 1 -

`properties.io_batch_size`


`batch_idp`


(Output) Will be used in subsequent batch IO calls.


**Returns**

`CU_FILE_SUCCESS`

on success.`CU_FILE_INTERNAL_ERROR`

on on any failures.

**Description**

This interface should be the first call in the sequence of batch I/O operation. This takes the maximum
number of batch entries the caller intends to use and returns a `CUFileBatchHandle_t`

which should
be used by the caller for subsequent batch I/O calls.

Refer to the following for more information:

### 5.5.2. cuFileBatchIOSubmit[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilebatchiosubmit)

```
CUfileError_t cuFileBatchIOSubmit(CUfileBatchHandle_t batch_idp,
unsigned nr,
CUfileIOParams_t *iocbp,
unsigned int flags)
```

**Parameters**

`batch_idp`


The address of the output parameter for the newly created batch ID, which was obtained from a

`cuFileBatchSetup`

call.

`nr`



The number of requests for the batch request.

The value must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to

`max_nr`

specified in`cuFileBatchIOSetup`

.

`iocbp`


The pointer contains the

`CUfileIOParams_t`

array structures of the length`nr`

array.

`flags`


Reserved for future use. Should be set to 0.


**Returns**

`CU_FILE_SUCCESS`

on success.`CU_FILE_INTERNAL_ERROR`

on any failures.

**Description**

This API will need to be used to submit a read/write operation on an array of GPU/CPU data pointers from their respective file handle, offset, and size bytes.

Based on the type of memory pointer, the data is transferred to/from the GPU memory by using GDS or the data is transferred to/from the CPU memory.

This is an asynchronous call and will enqueue the operation on a

`batch_id`

provided by the`cuFileIOSetup`

API. The operation can be monitored when using this`batch_id`

through`cuFileBatchIOGetStatus`

.The operation can be canceled by calling

`cuFileBatchIOCancel`

or destroyed by`cuFileBatchIODestroy`

.

The entries in the

`CUfileIOParams_t`

array describe individual IOs.The bytes transacted field is valid only when the status indicates a completion.

Operations that are enqueued with cuFile Batch APIs are FIFO ordered with respect to other work on the stream and must be completed before continuing to the next action in the stream. Operations in each batch might be reordered with respect to each other.

The status field of individual IO operations via

`CUfileIOParams_t`

entries will have undefined values before the entire batch is complete. This definition is subject to change.

Refer to the following for more information:

### 5.5.3. cuFileBatchIOGetStatus[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilebatchiogetstatus)

```

CUfileIOEvents_t *iocbp,
struct timespec* timeout));
```

**Parameters**

`batch_idp`


Obtained during setup.


`min_nr`


The minimum number of IO entries for which status is requested. The

`min_nr`

should be greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to`*nr`

.

`nr`


This is a pointer to max requested IO entries to poll for completion and is used as an Input/Output parameter. As an input

`*nr`

must be set to pass the maximum number of IO requests to poll for. As an output,`*nr`

returns the number of completed I/Os.

`iocbp`



`CUFileIOEvents_t`

array containing the status of completed I/Os in that batch.

`timeout`


This parameter is used to specify the amount of time to wait for in this API, even if the minimum number of requests have not completed. If the timeout hits, it is possible that the number of returned IOs can be less than

`min_nr`

.

**Returns**

`CU_FILE_SUCCESS`

on success.The success here refers to the completion of the API. Individual IO status and error can be obtained by examining the returned status and error in the array iocbp.

`CU_FILE_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE`

for an invalid batch ID.

**Description**

This is a batch API to monitor the status of batch IO operations by using the

`batch_id`

that was returned by`cuFileBatchIOSubmit`

. The operation will be canceled automatically if`cuFileBatchIOCancel`

is called and the status will reflect`CU_FILE_CANCELED`

for all canceled IO operations.The status of each member of the batch is queried, which would not be possible with one

`CUEvent`

. The status field of individual IO operations via`CUfileIOParams_t`

entries will have undefined values before the entire batch is completed. This definition is subject to change.

Refer to the following for more information:

### 5.5.4. cuFileBatchIOCancel[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilebatchiocancel)

## 5.6. cuFile Stats API Functional Specification[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-stats-api-functional-specification)

The cuFile Stats API provides comprehensive performance monitoring and statistics collection for GPUDirect Storage operations. These APIs enable applications to gather detailed metrics on I/O operations including throughput, latency, operation counts, and resource utilization.

Statistics can be collected at three different levels of detail:

**Level 1**: Basic statistics including operation counts, bytes transferred, bandwidth, and average latency.**Level 2**: Level 1 plus I/O size distribution histograms for read and write operations.**Level 3**: Level 2 plus per-GPU breakdown showing which GPUs are used, operation types (P2P / NVFS / POSIX), and buffer registration metrics.

The API allows applications to dynamically control when statistics collection starts and stops, query current settings, retrieve accumulated statistics, and reset counters for measuring specific workloads. Higher statistics levels provide more detailed information but incur increasing performance overhead.

### 5.6.1. cuFileSetStatsLevel[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilesetstatslevel)

```
CUfileError_t cuFileSetStatsLevel(int level)
```

**Parameters**

`level`


Statistics level (0 = disabled, 1 = basic, 2 = detailed, 3 = verbose).


**Returns**

CU_FILE_SUCCESS

On success.


CU_FILE_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE

If

`level`

is invalid.

**Description**

Set the level of statistics collection for cuFile operations. This overrides
the `cufile.json`

settings for stats. Higher stats levels may impact
performance. Level 0 disables statistics collection. Changes to stats level
take effect for future operations. Must be called before
`cuFileStatsStart()`

to take effect.

### 5.6.2. cuFileGetStatsLevel[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilegetstatslevel)

```
CUfileError_t cuFileGetStatsLevel(int *level)
```

**Parameters**

`level`


Pointer to store the current statistics level.


**Returns**

CU_FILE_SUCCESS

On success.


CU_FILE_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE

If

`level`

pointer is NULL.

**Description**

Get the current level of statistics collection for cuFile operations. Returns the currently configured stats level (0–3) in the provided pointer.

### 5.6.3. cuFileStatsStart[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilestatsstart)

```
CUfileError_t cuFileStatsStart(void)
```

**Parameters**

None.

**Returns**

CU_FILE_SUCCESS

On success.


CU_FILE_DRIVER_NOT_INITIALIZED

If the driver is not initialized.


**Description**

Start collecting cuFile statistics. The statistics level must be set with a
level greater than 0 before calling this function. Statistics counters begin
accumulating from this point and can be stopped and restarted without resetting
counters unless `cuFileStatsReset()`

is called.

### 5.6.4. cuFileStatsStop[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilestatsstop)

```
CUfileError_t cuFileStatsStop(void)
```

**Parameters**

None.

**Returns**

CU_FILE_SUCCESS

On success.


CU_FILE_DRIVER_NOT_INITIALIZED

If the driver is not initialized.


**Description**

Stop collecting cuFile statistics. Accumulated statistics remain available for
querying until reset or driver close. Statistics counters are preserved and can
still be queried. Collection can be restarted with `cuFileStatsStart()`

to
continue accumulating. Use `cuFileStatsReset()`

to clear all counters.

### 5.6.5. cuFileStatsReset[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilestatsreset)

```
CUfileError_t cuFileStatsReset(void)
```

**Parameters**

None.

**Returns**

CU_FILE_SUCCESS

On success.


CU_FILE_DRIVER_NOT_INITIALIZED

If the driver is not initialized.


**Description**

Reset all cuFile statistics counters to zero. This clears all accumulated statistics data across all levels. Can be called while statistics collection is active or stopped. Useful for measuring statistics over specific time periods or operation sets.

### 5.6.6. cuFileGetStatsL1[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilegetstatsl1)

```
CUfileError_t cuFileGetStatsL1(CUfileStatsLevel1_t *stats)
```

**Parameters**

`stats`


Pointer to

`CUfileStatsLevel1_t`

structure to be filled.

**Returns**

CU_FILE_SUCCESS

On success.


CU_FILE_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE

If

`stats`

is NULL or level 1 stats are not enabled.

CU_FILE_DRIVER_NOT_INITIALIZED

If the driver is not initialized.


**Description**

Get Level 1 cuFile statistics. Level 1 provides basic I/O and operation counters including read and write operations, bytes transferred, bandwidth, latency, and batch operation statistics.

### 5.6.7. cuFileGetStatsL2[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilegetstatsl2)

```
CUfileError_t cuFileGetStatsL2(CUfileStatsLevel2_t *stats)
```

**Parameters**

`stats`


Pointer to

`CUfileStatsLevel2_t`

structure to be filled.

**Returns**

CU_FILE_SUCCESS

On success.


CU_FILE_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE

If

`stats`

is NULL or level 2 stats are not enabled.

CU_FILE_DRIVER_NOT_INITIALIZED

If the driver is not initialized.


**Description**

Get Level 2 cuFile statistics. Level 2 includes all Level 1 statistics plus size histograms for read and write operations. The histograms track the distribution of I/O operation sizes, useful for analyzing I/O size patterns and optimization.

# 7. Static Topology Support[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#static-topology-support)

This section describes user-specified routing in GDS. Starting with GDS 1.17, users can control routing directly or automatically generate a `topology.json`

file using `gdscheck.py`

.

## 7.1. Topology discovery methods[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#topology-discovery-methods)

`gdscheck.py`

can generate a topology file using one of the following methods:

**cufile**Gathers topology information using`cuFileExportPCIeTopology()`

.**sysfs**Reads system files to collect PCIe topology information.**latency**Measures transaction latency between GPUs and NVMe devices, and between GPUs and NICs, and uses those values as a heuristic.This method requires all of the following:

Root privileges.

The Perftest package is installed.

The

`nvidia-peermem`

driver is loaded.`ib_read_lat`

is available on`PATH`

.`socket`

,`numa_node`

, and`pcie_group`

are determined by the user.

This method is most useful for CSP environments where the underlying bare-metal topology cannot be determined.


## 7.2. Using the topology file[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-the-topology-file)

Once the topology file is generated, cuFile consumes the `topology.json`

file when both `enable_static_routing`

and `static_routing_filepath`

are set. cuFile uses the values in `topology.json`

to build an internal topology according to the following rules:

Lower preference orders have higher priority.

The preference order range is from

`0x1`

(minimum) to`0x7000`

(maximum).Penalties are applied as follows:

Different root port: apply a penalty.

Different root port and NUMA node or socket: apply a larger penalty.

Different root port, NUMA node, and socket: apply the largest penalty.



cuFile rejects the JSON file if it is malformed or contains negative entries.

# 8. Known Limitations of cuFile Batch APIs[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#known-limitations-of-cufile-batch-apis)

This section provides information about the known limitations of cuFile Batch APIs in this release of GDS.
