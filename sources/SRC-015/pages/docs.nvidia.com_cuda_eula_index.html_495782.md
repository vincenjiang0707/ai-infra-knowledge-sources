**Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing, copying or using the licensed software:**

This license agreement, including exhibits attached (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA Corporation (“NVIDIA”) and governs your use of a NVIDIA software development kit (“SDK”).

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here is a description of the types of items that may be included in a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets (examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos, native API input/output files), binary software, sample code, libraries, utility programs, programming code and documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case “you” will mean the entity you represent.

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use the SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions.

##
1.1. License[](https://docs.nvidia.com#license)

###
1.1.1. License Grant[](https://docs.nvidia.com#license-grant)

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this Agreement) to:

Install and use the SDK,

Modify and create derivative works of sample source code delivered in the SDK, and

Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in object code format into a software application that meets the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.


###
1.1.2. Distribution Requirements[](https://docs.nvidia.com#distribution-requirements)

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise the distribution grant:

Your application must have material additional functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.

The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be accessed by your application.

The following notice shall be included in modifications and derivative works of sample source code distributed: “This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA Corporation.”

Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use only.

The terms under which you distribute your application must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including (without limitation) terms relating to the license grant and license restrictions and protection of NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you agree that you will protect the privacy, security and legal rights of your application users.

You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed SDK.


###
1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK[](https://docs.nvidia.com#pre-release-sdk)

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and reliability standards relative to commercial versions of NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or other unpredictable damage or loss.

You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production or business-critical systems.

NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon development and terminate the availability of a pre-release SDK at any time without liability.

###
1.1.5. Updates[](https://docs.nvidia.com#updates)

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in future versions of the SDK.

###
1.1.6. Components Under Other Licenses[](https://docs.nvidia.com#components-under-other-licenses)

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be distributed with, NVIDIA or third-party components with separate legal notices or terms as may be described in proprietary notices accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent there is a conflict between the terms in this Agreement and the license terms associated with the component, the license terms associated with the components control only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the SDK to develop and test applications released under Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software licenses.

###
1.1.7. Reservation of Rights[](https://docs.nvidia.com#reservation-of-rights)

[SoftFloat](http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/SoftFloat.html)library which is subject to the following license:The SoftFloat package was written by me, John R. Hauser. Release 3 of SoftFloat was a completely new implementation supplanting earlier releases. The project to create Release 3 (now through 3e) was done in the employ of the University of California, Berkeley, within the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, first for the Parallel Computing Laboratory (Par Lab) and then for the ASPIRE Lab. The work was officially overseen by Prof. Krste Asanovic, with funding provided by these sources: Par Lab: Microsoft (Award #024263), Intel (Award #024894), and U.C. Discovery (Award #DIG07-10227), with additional support from Par Lab affiliates Nokia, NVIDIA, Oracle, and Samsung. ASPIRE Lab: DARPA PERFECT program (Award #HR0011-12-2-0016), with additional support from ASPIRE industrial sponsor Intel and ASPIRE affiliates Google, Nokia, NVIDIA, Oracle, and Samsung. The following applies to the whole of SoftFloat Release 3e as well as to each source file individually.
