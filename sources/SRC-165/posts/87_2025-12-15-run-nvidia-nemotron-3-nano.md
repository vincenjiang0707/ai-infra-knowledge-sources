# Run Highly Efficient and Accurate AI Agents with NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Nano on vLLM

**Jan 28th Update**: NVIDIA just released their Nemotron 3 Nano model in NVFP4 precision. This model is supported by vLLM out of the box and it uses a new method called Quantization-Aware Distillation (QAD) to maintain accuracy on NVFP4 while delivering 4x throughput on B200 compared to FP8-H100. You can download the NVFP4 checkpoints [here](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-NVFP4) and run them using this [NVIDIA Brev launchable](https://brev.nvidia.com/launchable/deploy?launchableID=env-386KFyCvmg3y22JIf0q8BUh6jia).

We are excited to release the NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Nano, supported by vLLM.

Nemotron 3 Nano is part of the newly announced Nemotron 3 family of most efficient open models with leading accuracy for building agentic AI applications. The Nemotron 3 family of models use a hybrid Mamba-Transformer MoE architecture and 1M token context length. This enables developers to build reliable, high-throughput agents across complex, multi-document, and long-duration operations.

Nemotron 3 Nano is fully open with open-weights, datasets and recipes so developers can easily customize, optimize, and deploy the model on their infrastructure for maximum privacy and security. The chart below shows that Nemotron 3 Nano leads is in the most attractive quadrant in Artificial Analysis Openness vs Intelligence Index

## Run optimized inference with vLLM

Nemotron 3 Nano, achieves accelerated [inference](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/ai-inference/) and serves more requests on the same GPU with [BF16](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16), [FP8](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-FP8) precision support. Follow these instructions to get started:

`Run the command below to install vLLM.`


`We can then serve this model via an OpenAI-compatible API`


`Once the server is up and running, you can prompt the model using the below code snippets`


For an easier setup with vLLM, refer to our getting started cookbook, available [here](https://brev.nvidia.com/launchable/deploy?launchableID=env-36ikINrMffBCbrtTVLr6MFcllcs).

## Highly efficient with leading accuracy for agentic tasks

Nemotron 3 Nano builds upon the hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture of our Nemotron Nano 2 models by replacing the standard feed forward network (FFN) layers with sparse MoE layers and most of the attention layers with Mamba-2. The MoE layers help us achieve better accuracy at a fraction of the active parameter count. With MoE architecture, Nemotron 3 Nano reduces compute requirements and meets the stringent latency requirements of real-world applications.

With hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, Nemotron 3 Nano delivers up to 4x higher token throughput, enabling the model to think faster and provide higher accuracy simultaneously. The "thinking budget" feature prevents the model from overthinking and optimizes for a lower, predictable inference cost.
