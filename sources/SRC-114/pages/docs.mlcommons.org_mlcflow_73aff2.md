**MLCFlow: Simplifying MLPerf Automations**

MLCFlow is a versatile CLI and Python interface developed by MLCommons in collaboration with a dedicated team of volunteers (see [Contributors](https://github.com/mlcommons/mlcflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md)). It serves as a streamlined replacement for the [CMind](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm) tool, designed to drive the automation workflows of MLPerf benchmarks more efficiently. You can use this tool for any of your workflow automation tasks.

The concept behind CMind originated from **Grigori Fursin**, while the **MLPerf Automations** project was created by **Grigori Fursin** and **Arjun Suresh**, whose collective contributions laid the foundation for modernizing MLPerf benchmarking tools. MLCFlow is a complete replacement for the CMind package with an entirely new implementation led by **Arjun Suresh** and **Anandhu Sooraj**, with support from the [MLCFlow community](https://github.com/mlcommons/mlcflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md). The script automation used in MLCFlow is inherited from the CM project but is now modified to support MLC and provides a simpler interface to the devlopers. Please see [the documentation](https://docs.mlcommons.org/mlcflow/) for more details.

On February 9, 2025, MLCFlow released its first stable version, 1.0.0.

### Key Features

Building upon the core idea of CMind—wrapping native scripts with Python wrappers and YAML metadata—MLCFlow focuses exclusively on key automation components: **Scripts**, along with its complementary modules: **Cache**, **Docker**, and **Experiments**. This targeted design simplifies both implementation and interface, enabling a more user-friendly experience.

### Status

MLCFlow is now fully equipped for workflow development, with complete support for all previously used CM scripts in MLPerf inference automation.

## MLC CLI Overview

The **MLC Command-Line Interface (CLI)** enables users to perform actions on specified targets using a simple syntax:

```
mlc <action> <target> [options]
```


### Key Components:

: The operation to be performed.`<action>`

: The object on which the action is executed.`<target>`

: Additional parameters passed to the action.`[options]`


### Supported Targets and Actions

#### 1. **Repo**

- Actions related to repositories, such as cloning or updating.

#### 2. **Script**

- Manage or execute automation scripts.

#### 3. **Cache**

- Handle cached data, including cleanup or inspection.

Each target has its own set of specific actions to tailor automation workflows as specified below.

| Target | Action |
|---|---|
| script | run, find/search, rm, mv, cp, add, test, docker-run, show, experiment, doc |
| cache | find/search, rm, show, list, prune, mark-tmp |
| repo | pull, search, rm, list, find/search , add |

MLC started with a compatibility layer where by it supported MLCommons CM automations - Script, Cache and Experiment. Now, MLCFLow has just the Script Automation which is an extension of the Script Automation from CM but with a cleaner integration of Cache Automation and Docker and Test extensions. The old CM scripts are now updated with the latest MLCFlow scripts in the [MLPerf Automations](https://github.com/mlcommons/mlperf-automations/tree/main/script) repository.
