# Analyzing Xid Errors with the Xid Catalog[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#analyzing-xid-errors-with-the-xid-catalog)

On Volta and older GPUs, see [Xid and SXid Errors with the Xid Catalog for older GPUs](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/xid-errors/archive/index.html).

For Ampere and newer GPUs (including PCIe form-factor GPUs), a catalog of possible Xid events is available in the graphs below. You can also download the spreadsheet below:

This event is logged for general user application faults. Typically this is an out-of-bounds error where the user has walked past the end of an array, but could also be an illegal instruction, illegal register, or other case. In rare cases, it’s possible for a hardware failure or system software bugs to materialize as XID 13. When this event is logged, NVIDIA recommends the following: 1. Run the application in cuda-gdb or the Compute Sanitizer memcheck tool , or 2. Run the application with CUDA_DEVICE_WAITS_ON_EXCEPTION=1 and then attach later with cuda-gdb, or 3. File a bug if the previous two come back inconclusive to eliminate potential NVIDIA driver or hardware bug. NOTE: The Compute Sanitizer memcheck tool instruments the running application and reports which line of code performed the illegal read. |

This event is logged when the GPU detects that an uncorrectable error occurs on the GPU. This is also reported back to the user application. A GPU reset or node reboot is needed to clear this error. The tool nvidia-smi can provide a summary of ECC errors. If the ECC error is reported for SRAM (excludes “framebuffer”), check for SRAM DBE thresholds and follow RMA flow if exceeded - (nvidia-smi <sram_threshold_exceeded> or NSM Msg Type 0x3, Cmd Code 0x7D, bit 0). If flag is set, run field diag. |

This event is logged when the GPU detects that a problem with a connection from the GPU to another GPU or NVSwitch over NVLink. A GPU reset or node reboot is needed to clear this error. This event may indicate a hardware failure with the link itself, or may indicate a problem with the device at the remote end of the link. For example, if a GPU fails, another GPU connected to it over NVLink may report an Xid 74 simply because the link went down as a result. The nvidia-smi nvlink command can provide additional details on NVLink errors, and connection information on the links. If this error is seen repeatedly and GPU reset or node reboot fails to clear the condition, contact your hardware vendor for support. |

This event is logged when the GPU driver attempts to access the GPU over its PCI Express connection and finds that the GPU is not accessible. This event is often caused by hardware failures on the PCI Express link causing the GPU to be inaccessible due to the link being brought down. Reviewing system event logs and kernel PCI event logs may provide additional indications of the source of the link failures. This event may also be cause by failing GPU hardware or other driver issues. |

This event is logged when the GPU driver fails to update the InfoROM due to violation of the provisioned InfoROM wear limit that was set for the GPU using NVFlash using nvflash –=elsessionstart. In most cases this is not indicative of a driver or flash failure, but rather the intentional use of the InfoROM wear protection feature as set by NVFlash. Recovery steps: The GPU can be recovered from Xid 93 by clearing InfoROM erase limit using ./nvflash –-elsessionclear. If clearing the limit using nvflash doesn’t help, report the issue to NVIDIA. |

These events (94/95) are logged when GPU drivers handle errors in GPUs that support error containment, starting with NVIDIA A100 GPUs. For Xid 94, these errors are contained to one application, and the application that encountered this error must be restarted. All other applications running at the time of the Xid are unaffected. It is recommended to reset the GPU when convenient. Applications can continue to be run until the reset can be performed. One possible cause of containment errors is the handling of ECC memory errors. Review the NVIDIA GPU Memory Error Management manual: Xid 45 will be seen in relation to this error. |

This event may occur when the GPU driver has observed corrected errors on the C2C NVLink connection to a Grace CPU. These errors are corrected by the system and have no operational impact. Resetting the GPU at an available service window will allow the GPU to retrain the link. NOTE: repeat errors may be reported; VBIOS 97.00.90.00.00 may provide some relief from that condition |

This event is logged when a fault is reported by the remote MMU, such as when an illegal NVLink peer-to-peer access is made by an applicable unit on the chip. Typically these are application-level bugs, but can also be driver bugs or hardware bugs. When this event is logged, NVIDIA recommends the following: #. Run the application in cuda-gdb or the Compute Sanitizer memcheck tool , or #. Run the application with CUDA_DEVICE_WAITS_ON_EXCEPTION=1 and then attach later with cuda-gdb, or #. File a bug if the previous two come back inconclusive to eliminate potential NVIDIA driver or hardware bug. |

INVESTIGATE_SW |
There is a problem with either user or NVIDIA software that needs to be investigated further. In many cases the user software may be making calls to illegal areas, poorly structured commands or other issues. This may also be a problem with NVIDIA software in which case an issue should be reported. In many cases there may be a PID that could be tracked back to the offending, originating entity. |
IGNORE (sympathetic) |
This is a sympathetic error that is expected to be seen with other conditions. Resolution for the other errors should be undertaken first. If this error was seen independently or all other resolutions aren’t suffficient then REPORT_ISSUE. |
XID_137_FLOW |
This event is logged when a fault is reported by the remote MMU, such as when an illegal NVLink peer-to-peer access is made by an applicable unit on the chip. Typically these are application-level bugs. When this event is logged, NVIDIA recommends the following: • Run the application in cuda-gdb or cuda-memcheck • Note: The cuda-memcheck tool instruments the running application and reports which line of code performed the illegal read. or • Run the application with CUDA_DEVICE_WAITS_ON_EXCEPTION=1 and then attach later with cuda-gdb File a bug if the previous two come back inconclusive to eliminate other possible causes. |

Resolution Action |
Steps to be taken to resolve the error that occurred. |

This catalog provides a detailed reference on each possible Xid, and provides information on the cause of the Xid, and actions to take. You can also download the [reference guide as a spreadsheet here](https://docs.nvidia.com/Xid-Catalog.xlsx).

The catalog is presented as a spreadsheet, with several sheets of information.

For a given Xid, use the following procedure to walk through the correct actions to take in handling the Xid.

## Step 1: Determine Xid Code[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#step-1-determine-xid-code)

Determine the Xid Code from the Xid Message.

Each Xid message contains a single code, following a colon after the GPU identifier. In the following examples, the Xid Codes are 14, 22013 and 79 respectively.

```
[...] NVRM: Xid (0000:03:00): 14, Channel 00000001
[...] NVRM: Xid (PCI:0000:5a:00): 79, GPU has fallen off the bus.
```

## Step 2: Review Xid Classification from the Xid Catalog[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#step-2-review-xid-classification-from-the-xid-catalog)

In the Xid Catalog, open the “Xids” sheet and find the row with a matching “Code” to the Xid Code from Step 1.

For example, for Xid 79:


For each row, the catalog provides a brief description of the Xid in the “Description” column, as well as applicability to different revisions of GPU in the “Applies to” columns.

Note that some Xid codes are deprecated on more recent GPU models. These Xids are listed as “Unused” for the description, indicating they may be deprecated and applicable to V100 or earlier GPUs.

## Step 3: Determine Data Center and Investigatory Actions[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#step-3-determine-data-center-and-investigatory-actions)

The Xid Catalog provides two different actions for handling an Xid.

**Immediate Action:**

The “Resolution Bucket - Immediate Action” column in the Xid Catalog provides an immediate action that should be performed to recover a system after an Xid is observed. This is intended as an automatable action that administrators can perform to recover the system from Xid error, and ready the system for new applications.

This action can be performed as automated recovery after an Xid.

**Investigatory Action:**

The data center action is intended to recover the system, but in some cases, where there is a persistent failure, the Xid will reoccur, requiring a more detailed investigation to the cause of the issue, and will help to further identify if there are underlying hardware, firmware or software failures that need longer term actions to correct the issue.

If the issue reoccurs, or is not expected, the Investigatory Action column provides guidance on actions to take to investigate the issue.

## Step 4: Determine Resolution Steps[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#step-4-determine-resolution-steps)

Both the **Data Center Action** and **Investigatory Action** columns provide a short summary **Resolution Bucket** that summarizes common actions to take that may be shared by different types of Xid codes. The actual steps to take for these actions are defined on the **Fault Resolution Buckets** worksheet.

For example, if data center action indicates a fault resolution bucket is “RESET_GPU,”” the row for `RESET_GPU`

in the Fault Resolution Bucket spreadsheet provides guidance on exact actions to take.


Similarly, the resolution steps for investigatory actions are presented on the same worksheet.
