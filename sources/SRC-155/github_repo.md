## README

# Kernel Design Agents

Kernel Design Agents (KDA) is an agent-centric workflow for using coding agents to research, implement, verify, and iterate on performance-sensitive CUDA kernel tasks.

This repository documents an early research prototype and remains under active development. Community feedback and contributions are welcome. If you are interested in HAN Lab Mafia's solutions ranking #1–3 on tracks at the MLSys Kernel Contest, see [mit-han-lab/mlsys2026-flashinfer-contest](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/mlsys2026-flashinfer-contest) for performance evaluation and reproduction.

## Community Kernel Wishlist

Have a kernel that needs optimization? [Submit a request](https://github.com/NVlabs/kda/tree/wishlist#submit) directly as a pull request to `wishlist`, with a reproducible definition, representative workloads, and your best-known baseline implementation. No issue is required. The community wishlist currently supports NVIDIA B200 and B300 GPUs only.

[Browse and upvote requests](https://github.com/NVlabs/kda/pulls?q=is%3Apr%20base%3Awishlist), [discuss an idea](https://github.com/NVlabs/kda/issues/new?title=%5Bwishlist%5D%20) if you need help preparing the files, or visit the [project website](https://nvlabs.github.io/kda/). Keep request details in `requests/<github-username>-<kernel-name>/README.md` and use the [wishlist PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/wishlist.md) for the short description. Merging records the request, while optimization progress and result links remain on the original pull request. Website source lives on `pages`; the PR template and issue chooser settings are maintained on `main`.

## Getting Started
Install the agent workflow dependencies before starting the agent session:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mit-han-lab/kernel-design-agents.git
cd kernel-design-agents

# link skills
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/skills/ncu-report-skill" ~/.claude/skills/ncu-report-skill
ln -s "$(pwd)/skills/KernelWiki" ~/.claude/skills/KernelWiki

# or clone the independently licensed ncu skill directly
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cd ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/mit-han-lab/ncu-report-skill.git
```

Use KernelWiki from this repository's pinned submodule. A direct upstream
checkout may contain artifact snapshots governed by additional terms that are
omitted from this distribution.

Install the `humanize` Claude Code plugin from the Claude Code plugin UI:

/plugin marketplace add PolyArch/humanize
/plugin install humanize@PolyArch
```

## Minimal Flow

1. Create a separate implementation workspace for the target task.
2. Define the task contract: objective, constraints, validation command, and promotion criteria.
3. Start an agent session in the implementation workspace.
4. Give the agent `prompts/basic-flow.md`, filled in with the task-specific details.
5. Ask the agent to write a short plan draft to `docs/draft.md` in the implementation workspace.
6. Convert the draft into an executable plan, either manually or with a planning tool such as Humanize.
7. Implement in small iterations, verifying after each meaningful change.
8. Record candidates, benchmark or evaluation results, profiling evidence, and final promotion decisions.

The workflow is intentionally independent of any single benchmark harness or hardware target. A downstream task can add its own evaluator, datasets, profiling tools, and domain-specific references.

## Recommended Workspace Layout

Use this repository as reference material, then do implementation work elsewhere:

```text
task-workspace/
  docs/
    draft.md
    plan.md
  runs/
  outputs/
  profile/
  benchmark.csv
  candidates.jsonl
```

The exact files can change by domain. The important rule is that the agent records enough context for another engineer to understand what was tried, what passed validation, and why the final candidate was selected.
