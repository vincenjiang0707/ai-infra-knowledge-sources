## Introduction

🌈 **SIM-CoT (Supervised Implicit Chain-of-Thought)** is a training framework for implicit reasoning that makes latent (implicit) CoT **stable, scalable, and interpretable.**

While implicit CoT can greatly reduce inference-time token cost compared to explicit chain-of-thought, prior approaches often suffer from **latent instability** when scaling the number of implicit tokens—leading to **semantic homogenization, operator information loss, and even training collapse**.

SIM-CoT addresses this by introducing **step-level supervision for implicit latents**. During training, we attach a lightweight **auxiliary decoder** to align each implicit latent token with a corresponding reasoning step, enforcing structured semantics in the latent space and improving optimization stability. Importantly, the auxiliary decoder is **removed at inference time**, so SIM-CoT **preserves the efficiency advantages of implicit reasoning** without adding any extra inference overhead.


## 💡 Highlights

- 🔥 **Latent Instability in Implicit CoT:** We systematically analyze the limitations of implicit Chain-of-Thought methods and reveal a **latent instability issue**—as the number of implicit tokens increases, models tend to collapse into homogeneous latent states that lose operator semantics.  

- 🔥 **Step-Level Supervision with SIM-CoT:** We propose **S**upervised **IM**plicit-CoT (**SIM-CoT**), a plug-and-play module that introduces **step-level supervision** via an auxiliary decoder. This stabilizes optimization, prevents collapse, and ensures that latent tokens capture meaningful reasoning steps.

- 🔥 **Strong and Consistent Performance:** SIM-CoT consistently outperforms both explicit and implicit baselines. On GPT-2, it exceeds supervised CoT by **+2.1%**, Coconut by **+8.2%**, and CODI by **+4.3%**. Across larger LLaMA models (1B/3B/8B), it delivers **+1.5% to +9.0%** gains, and remains stable even with **8–16 implicit tokens**, where prior methods collapse.  

- 🔥 **Efficiency and Interpretability:** SIM-CoT adds **no extra inference cost** since the auxiliary decoder is discarded after training. It also provides **interpretability**, allowing each latent token to be decoded into a human-readable reasoning step.
