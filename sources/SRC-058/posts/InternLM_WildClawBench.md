> **Hard, practical, end-to-end evaluation for AI agents — in the wild.**

---

**WildClawBench** is an agent benchmark that tests what actually matters: can an AI agent do real work, end-to-end, without hand-holding?

We drop agents into a live [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) environment — the same open-source personal AI assistant that real users rely on daily — and throw **60 original tasks** at them: clipping goal highlights from a football match, negotiating meeting times over multi-round emails, hunting down contradictions in search results, writing inference scripts for undocumented codebases, catching privacy leaks before they happen. Useful things. Hard things.

In the **technical report snapshot**, the strongest frontier model topped out at **62.2% overall**; the latest audited OpenClaw runs have since raised the best score to **67.2%**. Most models still land well below that. That makes scores mean something.

### Why WildClawBench?

Most agent benchmarks test isolated capabilities — calling a function, parsing JSON, following a single instruction. WildClawBench tests the full picture:

| | What We Test | Why It's Hard |
|:---:|---|---|
| **🔗 Agency** | Multi-step tool orchestration, error recovery, autonomous planning | Agents must chain 10–60+ tool calls, adapt when services fail, and decide *what* to do — not just *how* |
| **🎥 Multimodal** | Video understanding, image generation, cross-modal synthesis | Track events across a 45-min match video and clip precise highlights; classify 12 clothing photos, assemble 4 styled outfits, and generate full-body model images for each |
| **🧵 Long-Horizon** | Complex workflows spanning 10–20 minutes of wall-clock execution | Negotiate meeting times over multiple email rounds; crawl, classify, and summarize 50+ academic papers |
| **💻 Coding** | Read undocumented codebases, debug, generate working programs | Read an undocumented codebase, install dependencies, and write working inference from source alone; solve visual puzzles by generating pixel-accurate solutions |
| **🛡️ Safety** | Prompt injection defense, credential leak detection, harmful content refusal | Harmful instructions are buried deep inside normal-looking documents; API keys are scattered across a large git history |

### What Sets Us Apart

- **Real environment, not mocks.** Tasks run inside a live OpenClaw instance with real tools (browser, bash, file system, email, calendar).
- **60 original tasks, built by hand.** Not adapted from existing benchmarks — each task was designed from scratch to stress-test real-world agent capabilities.
- **Four agent harnesses, one task suite.** OpenClaw, Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Hermes Agent all execute the same 60 tasks under the same grading. This separates *model capability* from *harness scaffolding* — you can see how much an agent's score depends on its surrounding tools versus the underlying LLM.
- **Reproducible & isolated.** Each task runs in its own Docker container. Same image, same data, same grading code. Ground truth and grading scripts are injected only after the agent finishes — they are never visible during execution, eliminating data leakage. Scores are reproducible across machines.

## The WildClawBench Family

The evaluation code lives in this repository; the benchmark data ships as three Hugging Face datasets — pick the one that matches how you want to use it:

| Repository | What's inside | Use it when you want to |
|---|---|---|
| **[WildClawBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/WildClawBench)** | Task data, Docker images for all four harnesses | Reproduce the paper's evaluation with this repository's pipeline |
| **[WildClawBench-Harbor](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/WildClawBench-Harbor)** | All 60 tasks repackaged in the [Harbor](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor) format | Evaluate any Harbor-supported agent with a single `harbor run` — no benchmark-specific setup ([details](#run-with-harbor)) |
| **[WildClawBench-Trajectories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/WildClawBench-Trajectories)** | Complete agent trajectories for the full 60-task suite, across a growing roster of frontier models, plus raw evaluation outputs | Inspect how models actually behave — or mine real long-horizon traces for analysis and training ([details](#agent-trajectories)) |

## Leaderboard

WildClawBench reports two complementary leaderboards:

1. **Model leaderboard (OpenClaw harness)** — apples-to-apples comparison of LLMs running inside the same OpenClaw harness.
2. **Harness comparison** — same model, same tasks, four different agent scaffolds.

Full interactive leaderboard at [internlm.github.io/WildClawBench](https://internlm.github.io/WildClawBench/).

### Model leaderboard (OpenClaw harness)

> **Overall score** follows the weighted Multimodal / Pure-text breakdown in that table. **Total time** and **total cost** are the paper’s Overall per-task averages (minutes / USD) multiplied by **60** for the full 60-task suite.

### Download Images

WildClawBench ships **four** Docker images, one per harness. They are all hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/WildClawBench/tree/main/Images). Pick the one(s) that match the harness you want to evaluate:

| Harness | Image tarball | Loaded tag |
|---|---|---|
| OpenClaw     | `wildclawbench-ubuntu_v1.3.tar`                       | `wildclawbench-ubuntu:v1.3` |
| Claude Code  | `wildclawbench-claudecode-ubuntu_v0.2-patched.tar`    | `wildclawbench-claudecode-ubuntu:v0.2` |
| Codex CLI    | `wildclawbench-codex-ubuntu_v0.0.tar`                 | `wildclawbench-codex-ubuntu:v0.0` |
| Hermes Agent | `wildclawbench-hermes-agent-v0.5.tar.gz`              | `wildclawbench-hermes-agent:v0.5` |

```bash
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"

# Download the images you need (or all four)
hf download internlm/WildClawBench Images/wildclawbench-ubuntu_v1.3.tar                    --repo-type dataset --local-dir .
hf download internlm/WildClawBench Images/wildclawbench-claudecode-ubuntu_v0.2-patched.tar --repo-type dataset --local-dir .
hf download internlm/WildClawBench Images/wildclawbench-codex-ubuntu_v0.0.tar              --repo-type dataset --local-dir .
hf download internlm/WildClawBench Images/wildclawbench-hermes-agent-v0.5.tar.gz           --repo-type dataset --local-dir .
```

Then load each image into Docker:

```bash
docker load -i Images/wildclawbench-ubuntu_v1.3.tar
docker load -i Images/wildclawbench-claudecode-ubuntu_v0.2-patched.tar
docker load -i Images/wildclawbench-codex-ubuntu_v0.0.tar
docker load -i Images/wildclawbench-hermes-agent-v0.5.tar.gz
```

### Download Task Data

Download the task data from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/WildClawBench/tree/main/workspace):

```bash
hf download internlm/WildClawBench workspace --repo-type dataset --local-dir .
```

### Prepare Data

Run the preparation script to download YouTube videos, place them into the correct task directories, and extract archived git repos:

```bash
bash script/prepare.sh
```

The script will:
- Download 3 YouTube videos (football match, lecture, product launch event)
- Extract the first half of the football match and discard the full video
- Rename and copy videos to the directories that need them
- Extract `dot_git.tar.gz` for Safety Alignment tasks
- Download SAM3 model weights for Code Intelligence tasks


Prerequisites: `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`, `gdown`.

> **Note:** YouTube downloads may require authentication. If you encounter a "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" error, try one of the following:
> - [Get cookies.txt locally](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc?pli=1).
> - Use `--cookies-from-browser` (e.g., `--cookies-from-browser chrome`)
> - Install [Deno](https://deno.land/) as a JS engine, which some users have reported resolves the issue

### Run

Set your API keys in the `.env` file:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_key_here  # required for search tasks
```

- **OpenRouter API Key** — Any model available on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/models) is supported. The default model is defined in the `.env` file as `DEFAULT_MODEL=openrouter/stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free` — replace it with any model you want to evaluate.
- **Brave Search API Key** — Required for Search & Retrieval tasks. Get one (with free monthly credits) at [brave.com/search/api](https://brave.com/search/api/).
- **Judge model** (optional) — `JUDGE_MODEL` controls the LLM used by judge-based grading metrics. Defaults to `openai/gpt-5.4`.

Then run one of the four harnesses:

```bash
bash script/run.sh openclaw     --category all --parallel 4 --model openrouter/openai/gpt-5.5
bash script/run.sh claudecode   --category all --parallel 4 --model openai/gpt-5.5
bash script/run.sh codex        --category all --parallel 4 --model openrouter/openai/gpt-5.5
bash script/run.sh hermesagent  --category all --parallel 4 --model openai/gpt-5.5
```

Single-task runs are also supported:

```bash
bash script/run.sh openclaw --task tasks/06_Safety_Alignment/06_Safety_Alignment_task_1_file_overwrite.md \
                            --model openrouter/openai/gpt-5.5
```

> Model-name conventions differ per harness:
> - **OpenClaw / Codex** expect `openrouter/<provider>/<model>` (since they hit OpenRouter directly).
> - **Claude Code / Hermes Agent** expect `<provider>/<model>` (the `openrouter/` prefix is added internally).

### Using a Custom Model Endpoint (Without OpenRouter)

This option currently applies to the **OpenClaw harness** only. If you prefer to use your own API endpoint instead of OpenRouter, you can provide a JSON file and WildClawBench will inject it into `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` before each task starts.

⚠️ Important: Some task prompts and evaluation scripts currently have OpenRouter explicitly mentioned or hardcoded (e.g., https://openrouter.ai/api/v1). If you bypass OpenRouter, you will need to adjust these references in the respective files manually.

**1. Fill in `my_api.json` (or provide your own JSON file with the same format):**
```json
{
  "providers": {
    "my-openai-proxy": {
      "baseUrl": "http://host.docker.internal:8000/v1",
      "apiKey": "${MY_PROXY_API_KEY}",
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "my-model",
          "name": "My Model"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This file is the value written into `openclaw.json["models"]`, so it should contain the `models` object itself, not the full `openclaw.json`. If you use `${MY_PROXY_API_KEY}`, WildClawBench will replace it on the host before the config is copied into the container, so `MY_PROXY_API_KEY` must be set in `.env`. WildClawBench always replaces the existing top-level `models` field with the JSON you provide.

**2. Set your model name and required API key in `.env`:**
```bash
MY_PROXY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**3. Run the benchmark with the models config file:**
```bash
python3 eval/run_batch.py --category 01_Productivity_Flow --models-config my_api.json --model my-openai-proxy/my-model
```

<details>
<summary>Common provider examples</summary>

OpenAI-compatible proxy:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "proxy": {
      "baseUrl": "http://host.docker.internal:8000/v1",
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "gpt-4o",
          "name": "GPT-4o"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "local-openai": {
      "baseUrl": "http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1",
      "models": [

          "name": "Qwen2.5 Coder 32B Instruct"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Provider with explicit API mode and env var key:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "custom-gateway": {
      "baseUrl": "http://host.docker.internal:9000/v1",
      "apiKey": "${MY_PROXY_API_KEY}",
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "my-reasoning-model",
          "name": "My Reasoning Model"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Run with Harbor

The full suite is also published in the [Harbor](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor) task format at **[internlm/WildClawBench-Harbor](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/WildClawBench-Harbor)**. Each of the 60 tasks is a self-contained Harbor task directory (`task.toml` / `instruction.md` / `environment/` / `tests/`), with task content and grading logic identical to this repository. This is the easiest way to evaluate agents that Harbor already supports (Claude Code, OpenHands, Codex CLI, custom agents, ...) — no benchmark-specific pipeline needed.

```bash
uv tool install harbor   # or: pip install harbor

# Task suite
hf download internlm/WildClawBench-Harbor --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./WildClawBench-Harbor

# Docker image (same OpenClaw image as above)
hf download internlm/WildClawBench Images/wildclawbench-ubuntu_v1.3.tar --repo-type dataset --local-dir .
docker load -i Images/wildclawbench-ubuntu_v1.3.tar

# Run the full benchmark (or point -p at a single task directory)
harbor run -p ./WildClawBench-Harbor -a claude-code -m anthropic/claude-opus-4-1 --n-concurrent 4
```

See the [WildClawBench-Harbor card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/WildClawBench-Harbor) for the task layout, environment details, and scoring.

## Check the Results

After the run completes, a per-category summary and a global summary (`output/summary_all.json`) are generated automatically. Each metric is scored from `0.00` to `1.00`.

Per-task results are saved under `output/<harness>/<category>/<task_id>/<model_timestamp_runid>/`:

```

The subdirectory name is `<short_model>_<timestamp>_<runid>`, where `short_model` is the last segment of the model path (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4.6` from `openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`) and `runid` is a 6-char random hex string, so parallel or repeated runs never collide.

## Agent Trajectories

For independent verification, side-by-side comparison, and trace-level analysis, we release **[internlm/WildClawBench-Trajectories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/WildClawBench-Trajectories)**: complete OpenClaw trajectories covering the full 60-task suite for each evaluated model — including recent frontier models such as GPT-5.6 Sol, Claude Fable 5, Claude Opus 4.8, Kimi K3, and more. The collection is continuously updated as new models join the leaderboard; see the [dataset card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/WildClawBench-Trajectories) for the current roster. The same data is provided in three forms:

- **`train.parquet`** — one row per (task, model) with the full message sequence as a JSON array; loads directly with `load_dataset("internlm/WildClawBench-Trajectories")` and renders in the HF Dataset Viewer (inline images replaced by hash placeholders to keep rows small).
- **`sessions/<model>/<task_id>.jsonl`** — per-session trace files for the HF **Agent Trace Viewer**: open any file, select the *Trace* tab, and step through reasoning blocks, tool calls, tool results, and token usage. These preserve the original inline image data.
- **`output_*.tar.gz`** — the raw per-task evaluation outputs (scores, usage, logs, agent-produced files) exactly as generated by the pipeline above.

## Personal OpenClaw Evaluation

"Raising lobsters" has become a phenomenon — users gradually teach their OpenClaw agents new skills, customize personalities, and build up long-term memory through daily interaction. A natural question follows: **whose lobster is better?** Beyond bragging rights, there is real value in understanding which skill combinations, persona designs, and memory strategies actually improve agent performance on a given model. That's why we created the **Personal OpenClaw Leaderboard**. Submit your lobster's results and see how it stacks up!


```bash
python eval/run_batch.py \
    --category all --parallel 4 \
    --model openrouter/xx/xxx \
    --lobster-name your-lobster-name \
    --lobster-workspace /path/to/your/workspace
```

- `--lobster-name` — identifier, used in the output directory.
- `--lobster-workspace` — path to your OpenClaw workspace (containing `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `skills/`, etc.).
- `--lobster-env` — (optional) comma-separated env var names for skills that need API keys (e.g. `GEMINI_API_KEY,FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`). Add the actual values to `.env`.

After the run completes, send the following to **wildclawbench@proton.me**:

1. Your `output/summary_all_<lobster-name>_<model>.json`
2. (Optional) A brief description of how you trained your OpenClaw (e.g. key skills, custom SOUL.md, memory strategies).

We will update the leaderboard periodically.

## Cleanup

If a run is interrupted (e.g. `Ctrl+C`, terminal closed), some Docker containers may be left behind. To remove **all** WildClawBench containers when no tasks are running:

```bash
for img in \
    wildclawbench-ubuntu:v1.3 \
    wildclawbench-claudecode-ubuntu:v0.2 \
    wildclawbench-codex-ubuntu:v0.0 \
    wildclawbench-hermes-agent:v0.5; do
  docker ps -a --filter "ancestor=$img" -q | xargs -r docker rm -f
done
```

To preview which containers would be removed (dry run), drop the `docker rm -f` step and use `--format "{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"`.
