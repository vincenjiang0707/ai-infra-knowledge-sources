# Latest News 🎉

- **[2025/09]** Our POLAR paper has been accepted by Neurips 2025.
- **[2025/09]** POLAR now supports RFT (Reinforcement Fine-tuning) training using VERL.


# Introduction

POLAR represents a significant breakthrough in scalar-based reward models achieved through large-scale pre-training. It leverages the innovative **POL**icy Discrimin**A**tive Lea**R**ning (**POLAR**) paradigm——a scalable, high-level optimization objective——to effectively discriminate between policies using a large-scale synthetic corpora. Following pre-training, POLAR RMs are fine-tuned with minimal preference data, rapidly aligning with human preferences. Key features of POLAR include:

* **Innovative Pre-training Paradigm:**  POLAR trains a reward model to discern identical policies and discriminate different ones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute preferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between two policies, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective suitable for modeling generic ranking relationships.

* **Tailored for Reinforcement Fine-tuning:** POLAR assigns rewards to LLM trajectories based on given references, perfectly aligning with the Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT) framework. POLAR provides a promising solution for applying RFT in generic scenarios.

* **Superior Performance and Generalization:** POLAR achieves state-of-the-art results on downstream reinforcement learning tasks, consistently delivering accurate and reliable reward signals that generalize effectively to unseen scenarios and significantly reducing reward hacking.

* **Easy to Customize:** Pre-trained checkpoints of POLAR are available, enabling researchers to conveniently fine-tune the RM for various customized scenarios, thus facilitating straightforward adaptation and expansion tailored to specific applications and experimental requirements.

# Model Zoo

We release POLAR reward models in sizes of 1.8B and 7B parameters. The "base" models (POLAR-1.8B-Base and POLAR-7B-Base) refer to pre-trained-only checkpoints, ideal for customized fine-tuning according to specific preferences. The "ready-to-use" checkpoints (POLAR-1.8B and POLAR-7B) have been already fine-tuned on general preference data, making them suitable for immediate use in most scenarios.

# Performance

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of POLAR via the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. We evaluate the downstream RL performances of four different policy models using [OpenCompass](https://github.com/internLM/OpenCompass/). More details are available in our [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05197).

<img src="./assets/result.png"/><br>

# Quick Start

This repository provides a `RewardModelClient` class (`src/polar/reward_func.py`) for querying reward values from a remote POLAR server. It handles input encoding, communication with different backends (sglang, vllm, lmdeploy), and returns the reward scores.

```python
from src.polar import RewardModelClient
```

Optionally, you can also use [XTuner](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner)’s implementation by installing XTuner and importing the class from XTuner.

```python
from xtuner.utils import RewardModelClient
```

For XTuner installation instructions, see the [Fine-tune](#fine-tune) section below.

## Inference

We support reward inference through [lmdeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy/), [sglang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/), and [vllm](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/). We recommend setting up a virtual environment with conda when using these inference engines to prevent potential dependency conflicts.

### Data format

Unlike traditional reward models, POLAR requires an additional reference trajectory as a demonstration and evaluate candidate trajectories by measuring their consistency with the provided reference.

```python
data = [
    {
        "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of China?"}],
        "reference": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Beijing."}],
        "output": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Beijing."}]
    },
    {
        "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of China?"}],
        "reference": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Beijing."}],
        "output": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Shanghai."}]
    }
]
```

### Inference with transformers

To load the POLAR model using transformers, use the following code to get rewards:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
from src.polar import RewardModelClient
# from xtuner.utils import RewardModelClient

model_name = 'internlm/POLAR-7B'

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    device_map="cuda", 
    trust_remote_code=True
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)

client = RewardModelClient(model_name)
encoded_data = client.encode(data)
batch = tokenizer(encoded_data, return_tensors='pt', padding=True).to('cuda')
outputs = model(**batch)
rewards = outputs[0].squeeze(-1).cpu().tolist()
print(rewards)

## RFT with VERL

POLAR can be easily integrated into various reinforcement learning frameworks. This repository provides an example showing how to use [VERL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with POLAR reward models.

### Environment Setup

Please refer to the [VERL official installation guide](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) for detailed environment setup instructions.

> **Note**: For training Qwen2.5 series, we recommend using the inference backend **vLLM 0.8.3** and **Transformers 4.50.3** for optimal performance. A higher version of transformers may cause training instability of Qwen2.5 series.

### Data Format

Training data should be in Parquet format with the following structure:
```python
{
    "data_source": "dataset_name",
    "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}, ...],
    "ability": "alility_type",
    "reward_model": {
        "style": "polar",
        "ground_truth": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]
    }
    "extra_info": {
        # The same as prompt. The purpose is for compatibible usage of verl and polar.
        "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}, ...],
    }
}
```

### Training steps

- **Step 1:** POLAR Deployment

  Deploy the POLAR reward model following the above [Inference](#inference) instructions. Update the server configuration in `src/polar/reward_func.py`:

  ```python
  # Config reward model server
  ADDRESS = "your_server_ip:port"  # Modify according to your server address
  SERVER_TYPE = "sglang"  # Options: "sglang", "vllm", "lmdeploy"
  MODEL_PATH = "internlm/POLAR-7B"
  ```

- **Step 2:** Data Preparation

  Prepare your training data in Parquet format. You can use the provided data preprocessing scripts:

  ```bash
  # Example: Process HH-RLHF dataset
  python examples/data_preprocess/full_hh_rlhf.py --local_dir ~/data/hh_rlhf
  ```

- **Step 3:** Configure Training Script

  An example of training script: `examples/ppo/qwen2_5-7b_hh-rlhf.sh`.

- **Step 4:** Run Training

  ```bash
  cd verl
  bash ../examples/ppo/qwen2_5-7b_hh-rlhf.sh
  ```

### Results

Here we show the RFT results of Qwen3-8B trained by our [official configs](https://github.com/InternLM/POLAR/blob/main/examples/ppo/qwen3-8b_general.sh), with the public [AM-DeepSeek-R1-0528-Distilled](https://huggingface.co/datasets/a-m-team/AM-DeepSeek-R1-0528-Distilled) dataset. We use [OpenCompass](https://github.com/internLM/OpenCompass/) for evaluation.

## Fine-tune

You could employ the latest [xtuner](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner) to fine-tune POLAR. Xtuner is an efficient, flexible and full-featured toolkit for fine-tuning LLMs.

- It is recommended to build a Python-3.10 virtual environment using conda

  ```bash
  conda create --name xtuner-env python=3.10 -y
  conda activate xtuner-env
  ```

- Install xtuner via pip

  ```shell
  pip install 'xtuner[deepspeed]'==0.2.0
  ```

- Install xtuner from the latest source code

  ```shell
  pip install 'git+https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner.git@main#egg=xtuner[deepspeed]'
  ```

### Requirements

- flash_attn
- tensorboard

### Data format

Unlike traditional reward models, POLAR requires an additional reference trajectory as a demonstration during fine-tuning, along with a chosen trajectory and a rejected trajectory. You can construct your fine-tuning data in a `train.jsonl` file, formatted as follows:

```json
{
    "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of China?"}],
    "reference": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Beijing."}],
    "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Beijing."}],
    "rejected": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Shanghai."}]
}
```

### Training steps

- **Step 0:** Prepare the config. We provide examplar ready-to-use configs [here](./examples/xtuner_configs/POLAR_7B_full_varlenattn_custom_dataset.py). If the provided configs cannot meet the requirements, please copy the provided config and do modification following the [xtuner guideline](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner/blob/main/docs/en/get_started/quickstart.md). For more details of reward model training settings, please see the xtuner [reward model guideline](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner/blob/main/docs/en/reward_model/modify_settings.md).

- **Step 1:** Start fine-tuning.

    ```shell
    xtuner train ${CONFIG_FILE_PATH}
    ```

  For example, you can start the fine-tuning of POLAR-7B-Base by

  ```shell
  # On a single GPU
  xtuner train ./examples/xtuner_configs/POLAR_7B_full_varlenattn_custom_dataset.py --deepspeed deepspeed_zero2

  # On multiple GPUs
  NPROC_PER_NODE=${GPU_NUM} xtuner train ./examples/xtuner_configs/POLAR_7B_full_varlenattn_custom_dataset.py --deepspeed deepspeed_zero2
  ```

  Here, `--deepspeed` means using [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) to optimize the training. Xtuner comes with several integrated strategies including ZeRO-1, ZeRO-2, and ZeRO-3. If you wish to disable this feature, simply remove this argument.

- **Step 2:** Convert the saved PTH model (if using DeepSpeed, it will be a directory) to Hugging Face model, by

  ```shell
  xtuner convert pth_to_hf ${CONFIG_FILE_PATH} ${PTH} ${SAVE_PATH}
  ```
