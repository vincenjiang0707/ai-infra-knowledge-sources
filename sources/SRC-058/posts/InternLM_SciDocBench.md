## Overview

Scientific papers combine text, equations, figures, tables, appendices, citations, code, and datasets. Reliable scientific-document assistants must therefore do more than retrieve visible text: they must locate evidence, verify numerical and logical relations, recover scientific structure, integrate information across documents, and produce reusable outputs.

**SciDocBench** evaluates these abilities through complete, evidence-grounded research tasks. It contains:

- **124** manually designed and difficulty-screened questions;
- **7** scientific-document capability groups and **19** subtasks;
- **5** scientific domains;
- **2** question languages: English and Chinese;
- **2** document representations: All Images First and Markdown Interleaved;
- **496** matched evaluation instances in total;
- **3** evaluator families: rule-based, LLM-as-a-judge, and execution-based evaluation.

Each question is instantiated under four matched settings while preserving its task semantics and evaluation criteria:

| Setting | Question language | Document representation |
|---|---|---|
| EN-AF | English | All Images First |
| EN-IL | English | Markdown Interleaved |
| ZH-AF | Chinese | All Images First |
| ZH-IL | Chinese | Markdown Interleaved |

## Capability Taxonomy

| Group | Capability |
|---|---|
| A | Document Perception and Structure |
| B | Scientific Information Extraction |
| C | Evidence Alignment and Verification |
| D | Cross-Document Understanding |
| E | Reconstruction and Execution |
| F | Paper-Code Alignment |
| G | Dataset Understanding |

## Leaderboard

Overall scores are computed over all 496 evaluation instances on a 0-100 scale. Failed or unusable responses receive zero.

| Rank | Model | Overall | EN-AF | EN-IL | ZH-AF | ZH-IL |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | **Claude Opus 5** | **62.60** | 63.19 | 61.34 | 65.21 | 60.68 |
| 2 | **GPT-5.6-Sol** | **61.00** | 61.07 | 60.32 | 61.32 | 61.31 |
| 3 | **Gemini 3.6 Flash** | **59.87** | 59.19 | 62.98 | 59.68 | 57.61 |
| 4 | Qwen3.8-Max | 57.15 | 59.55 | 55.33 | 58.13 | 55.57 |
| 5 | Qwen3.7-Plus | 55.88 | 57.17 | 53.34 | 57.57 | 55.42 |
| 6 | GPT-5.6-Terra | 54.19 | 51.88 | 55.69 | 52.83 | 56.37 |
| 7 | Claude Opus 4.8 | 53.41 | 53.63 | 52.43 | 54.13 | 53.46 |
| 8 | Qwen3.8-27B | 52.89 | 58.65 | 47.25 | 54.21 | 51.46 |
| 9 | GPT-5.6-Luna | 50.58 | 47.55 | 53.99 | 46.65 | 54.13 |
| 10 | Kimi K2.5 | 50.38 | 54.74 | 45.42 | 55.04 | 46.33 |
| 11 | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | 49.57 | 52.25 | 51.18 | 53.62 | 41.21 |
| 12 | GLM-4.6V | 42.44 | 43.30 | 46.70 | 38.21 | 41.56 |
| 13 | Claude Haiku 4.5 | 40.35 | 38.18 | 42.72 | 38.33 | 42.16 |
| 14 | MiMo-V2.5 | 40.16 | 42.26 | 39.26 | 44.66 | 34.46 |

Claude Opus 5 currently ranks first with 62.60, followed by GPT-5.6-Sol with 61.00 and Gemini 3.6 Flash with 59.87. No evaluated model reaches 63. Capability leaders are distributed across model families, indicating that strong performance in one scientific-document skill does not automatically transfer to the complete workflow. For 11 of the 14 evaluated models, the document-representation gap is larger than the question-language gap.

## Benchmark Data

The complete [SciDocBench benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HenryExcellent/SciDocBench) is publicly available on Hugging Face. The release contains 496 evaluation instances derived from 124 semantic questions, with 124 instances in each language-representation setting. It includes 7,052 image references and 2,758 unique document images after SHA-256 deduplication.

The repository provides a Hugging Face Parquet test split, a portable VLMEvalKit-compatible `SciDocBench.tsv`, content-addressed image assets, and integrity manifests with file and image checksums. Download it with:

```bash
hf download HenryExcellent/SciDocBench \
  --repo-type dataset \
  --local-dir SciDocBench
```

For an offline VLMEvalKit installation, materialize the benchmark under `LMUData`:

```bash
cp SciDocBench/SciDocBench.tsv "$LMU_DATA/SciDocBench.tsv"
mkdir -p "$LMU_DATA/images/SciDocBench"
cp -a SciDocBench/images/SciDocBench/. "$LMU_DATA/images/SciDocBench/"
```

## Training Data

The [SciDocBench Training Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HenryExcellent/SciDocBench-Training-Data) release provides benchmark-oriented multimodal data for supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning:

| Split | Examples | Image references |
|---|---:|---:|
| SFT | 4,000 | 28,258 |
| RL | 10,219 | 71,983 |
| **Total** | **14,219** | **100,241** |

The release contains 49,244 unique images after SHA-256 deduplication. It preserves ordered multimodal conversations, bilingual questions, document-input variants, SFT reasoning traces, and RL solutions used by the reward implementation. JSONL files use portable, content-addressed image paths. Images are distributed in 20 tar shards to keep the repository practical to download and verify.

Download and materialize the dataset with:

```bash
hf download HenryExcellent/SciDocBench-Training-Data \
  --repo-type dataset \
  --local-dir SciDocBench-Training-Data

cd SciDocBench-Training-Data
for shard in image_shards/images-*.tar; do
  tar -xf "${shard}"
done
```

After extraction, the relative paths in `data/sft/train.jsonl` and `data/rl/train.jsonl` resolve directly. The repository also includes `dataset_info.json` for LLaMA-Factory registration, a release manifest, per-shard checksums, and an image manifest. See the [dataset card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HenryExcellent/SciDocBench-Training-Data) for field definitions and licensing notes.

## Evaluation with VLMEvalKit

SciDocBench is available in [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit), which is the recommended evaluation entry point. After downloading the benchmark automatically or materializing the offline release as shown above, run:

```bash
python run.py --data SciDocBench --model <MODEL_NAME> --verbose
```

Replace `<MODEL_NAME>` with a model registered in VLMEvalKit. The command performs inference and evaluation. Configure the credentials required by the selected model and semantic judge according to the VLMEvalKit documentation.
