**CapRL 3.0 series (CapRL++)**: **CapRL-Video-4B** has been released! CapRL++ extends the original image-caption RL framework to a unified image and video captioning paradigm with verifiable rewards.

We are excited to release the **CapRL 2.0 series**: **CapRL-Qwen3VL-2B** and **CapRL-Qwen3VL-4B**. These models feature fewer parameters while delivering even more powerful captioning performance. 
Notably, **CapRL-Qwen3VL-2B outperforms both CapRL-Qwen2.5VL-3B and Qwen2.5VL-72B in captioning tasks, while CapRL-Qwen3VL-4B further demonstrates a significant performance leap over the 2B version.**
This improvement in efficiency is driven by our upgraded training recipe, which includes a more rigorous QA data filter and a significantly more diverse image dataset. We welcome everyone to try them out!


When selecting between the available CapRL models, it's essential to consider the trade-off between performance and computational cost.

## Introduction
🌈 We are excited to introduce the **CapRL series**, a family of dense captioning models trained with reinforcement learning rather than conventional supervised caption imitation.

The original **CapRL** framework focuses on dense image captioning. It optimizes an LVLM captioner with QA-derived rewards: a caption is considered high quality when a text-only model can answer visual questions using only that caption. With this recipe, the lightweight **CapRL-3B** achieves perception capabilities comparable to Qwen2.5-VL-72B.

**CapRL++** further generalizes this idea from static images to dynamic videos. It trains a Qwen3-VL-based captioner with a unified RLVR pipeline, where generated captions are evaluated by their downstream utility for multiple-choice visual question answering. For videos, CapRL++ adds timestamp-format rewards and length-aware regularization so the model learns dense, temporally grounded, and non-redundant descriptions.

## 💡 Highlights
- 🔥 **Unified dense caption RL for images and videos**: CapRL++ applies the same QA-utility reward philosophy to both image and video captioning, avoiding dependence on a single reference caption.
- 🔥 **Verifiable reward design**: CapRL++ combines visual utility reward, timestamp-format reward, and length-aware penalty to optimize accuracy, temporal structure, and information efficiency.
- 🔥 **Strong temporal grounding**: CapRL-Video-4B generates explicit timestamped video descriptions and improves downstream video understanding when used as caption data.
- 🔥 **Remarkable visual understanding for charts, infographics, and documents**: CapRL-3B achieves perception accuracy and visual information coverage comparable to Qwen2.5-VL-72B.
- 🔥 **Well-organized dense output**: CapRL models generate structured captions that cover fine-grained objects, attributes, OCR content, relations, and events.

## Model Card
- Based on the same recipe as CapRL-3B, we used InternVL3.5-8B as the policy model and obtained CapRL-InternVL3.5-8B through CapRL.
- CapRL-3B-GGUF is static quants version, and CapRL-3B-i1-GGUF is weighted/imatrix quants version. Thanks for their contribution!
- CapRL-Video-4B is trained from Qwen3-VL-4B with CapRL++ for dense video captioning. It is designed to describe both spatial details and temporal event changes with timestamped structure.


## 👨‍💻 Todo

- ✅ Release 75k QA dataset.

## CapRL++: Unified Image and Video Caption RL

CapRL++ is the video-oriented extension of CapRL. It keeps the central principle of CapRL: **a caption should be rewarded by how useful it is for downstream visual question answering**. Instead of comparing a generated caption with a fixed reference, CapRL++ lets the policy model generate captions, then asks a separate vision-free LLM to answer curated multiple-choice questions using only those captions. The answer accuracy becomes a verifiable reward for RL training.

### Reward Design

For a sampled caption `c`, CapRL++ uses a multidimensional reward:

```text
R_total(c) = R_acc(c) + alpha * R_format(c) + beta * R_len(c)
```

- **Visual utility reward (`R_acc`)**: measures whether a text-only LLM can answer image/video MCQs from the generated caption alone. Options are shuffled and sampled multiple times to reduce answer-position bias.
- **Temporal format reward (`R_format`)**: used for video captions. It encourages valid timestamp brackets and chronological ordering, helping the model produce temporally grounded narratives.
- **Length-aware reward (`R_len`)**: discourages reward hacking through overly long or repetitive captions, pushing the model toward high information density.

### Static-to-Dynamic Bootstrapping

CapRL++ uses **S2D-Boot**, a two-stage image-to-video training recipe:

1. **Image stage**: train on static images with visual utility and length rewards to strengthen fine-grained spatial perception, OCR, attributes, and relation extraction.
2. **Video stage**: initialize from the image-stage checkpoint and train on video data with the full reward space, including timestamp-format reward, so optimization can focus on event ordering and temporal localization.

This progressive strategy preserves strong image captioning ability while improving video understanding.

### CapRL++ Datasets

- **[CapRL-Video-QA-20K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/CapRL-Video-QA-20K)**: multiple-choice video QA data for CapRL++ reward training.
- **[CapRL-Video-178K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/CapRL-Video-178K)**: LLaVA-Video-178K videos recaptioned by **[CapRL-Video-4B](https://huggingface.co/internlm/CapRL-Video-4B)** with dense, timestamped descriptions.

- [`CapRL++/train/scripts/README.md`](CapRL++/train/scripts/README.md)
- [`CapRL++/eval/README.md`](CapRL++/eval/README.md)

## 🛠️ Setup

### Installation

For CapRL image training and evaluation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InternLM/CapRL.git
cd CapRL/CapRL_Training
conda create -n CapRL python=3.10
conda activate CapRL
bash setup.sh
```

The `setup.sh` will sequentially:
1. Install key dependencies with pinned versions (torch, transformers, vllm, deepspeed, flash-attn, ray, etc.)
2. Install the OpenRLHF-based training framework and remaining dependencies via `pip install -e .`

For CapRL++ video training and evaluation:

```bash
cd CapRL/CapRL++/train
conda create -n caprl python=3.10 -y
conda activate caprl
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
pip install -e ./verl
```

Video Prism evaluation dependencies are installed separately:

```bash
cd CapRL/CapRL++/eval
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ⭐️ Quick Start
If you want to use **CapRL-3B** for captioning, you can directly follow the exact same inference approach as in [Qwen2.5-VL-series](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-VL/tree/d2240f11656bfe404b9ba56db4e51cd09f522ff1).

The prompt we use for training and evaluation is `Please describe this image in detail.`

We recommend using **vLLM** to speed up inference.

For **CapRL-Video-4B**, use the Qwen3-VL video inference interface or the Prism evaluation scripts under `CapRL++/eval`. A typical video caption prompt is:

```text
Please describe this video in detail.
```

For explicit timestamps, you may try:

```text
You are a video captioner. Describe this video in strictly chronological order and in great detail. \n\nYour description should cover:\n1. **Key Visuals:** Detailed appearance of main characters (clothing, colors, gender) and prominent objects.\n2. **Actions & Timestamps:** Specific movements and interactions (e.g., instead of \"he moved,\" say \"he walked quickly towards the door\"). **Crucially, you must anchor distinct actions, events, and state changes with exact timestamps using the format `[mm:ss]` or `[mm:ss - mm:ss]`.**\n3. **Sequence:** Clearly state the order of events from start to finish, explicitly noting when actions happen simultaneously or sequentially.\n4. **Setting:** Describe the background environment and lighting.\n\nGoal: Provide a comprehensive and temporally precise description so that someone who cannot see this video can visualize it perfectly and map out an exact mental timeline of all events.\n\nExample Format:\n\"[00:00 - 00:05] A man wearing a red jacket stands by a window in a dimly lit room. [00:06] He suddenly turns around and [00:08 - 00:12] walks quickly towards a wooden desk.
```


### Start an OpenAI API Service

Run the command below to start an OpenAI-compatible API service:

```bash
vllm serve "/PATH/CapRL-3B" \
    --trust-remote-code \
    --tensor-parallel-size=1 \
    --pipeline-parallel-size=1 \
    --gpu_memory_utilization=0.95 \
    --served-model-name=caprl \
    --port 8000 \
    --host 0.0.0.0
```

Then you can use the chat API as below: (see [OpenAI API protocol document](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision/uploading-base-64-encoded-images) for more details):
```python
import base64
from openai import OpenAI
# Set OpenAI's API key and API base to use vLLM's API server.
openai_api_key = "EMPTY"
openai_api_base = "http://localhost:8000/v1"
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=openai_api_key,
    base_url=openai_api_base,
)
image_path = "/path/to/local/image.png"
with open(image_path, "rb") as f:
    encoded_image = base64.b64encode(f.read())
encoded_image_text = encoded_image.decode("utf-8")
base64_qwen = f"data:image;base64,{encoded_image_text}"
chat_response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="caprl",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": base64_qwen
                    },
                },
                {"type": "text", "text": "Please describe this image in detail."},
            ],
        },
    ],
    temperature=1.0,
    max_tokens=max_tokens,
    top_p=1.0,
    extra_body={
        "repetition_penalty": 1.0,
        },
)
print("Chat response:", chat_response)
```
## QA Curation

This part of the code is in the `QA_data_curation` folder, which contains all four steps for generating QA data:

1. **QA generation.** Use Qwen2.5-VL-72B to generate 5 QAs for each image. The generation process launches a vLLM service and uses multi-threading to speed up.
2. **QA extraction.** Extract QAs through format matching.
3. **Qwen2.5-VL-3B answer question.** Use Qwen2.5-VL-3B to answer questions with and without images. The parameter `ROTATE_NUM` controls how many times each question is answered. If a question is answered only once, the randomness may be too high and can easily lead to misjudgment.
4. **Filter question.** We keep QA pairs with `visual acc` higher than 0.75 and `text acc` lower than 0.25 to avoid data leakage and ensure the model can correctly answer questions when images are provided.


## CapRL Training

All training scripts are located in `CapRL_Training/scripts/`. Taking `qwen2.5vl3b_75k_reward_qwen2.5_3b` as an example:

**Step 1: Start the reward server**

```bash
cd CapRL_Training
bash scripts/qwen2.5vl3b_75k_reward_qwen2.5_3b/reward/rjob.sh
```

Once the reward server is running, note its **IP address**.

**Step 2: Launch training**

Set `<REWARD_SERVER_IP>` in `training/launch.sh` to the IP from Step 1, then:

```bash
bash scripts/qwen2.5vl3b_75k_reward_qwen2.5_3b/training/rjob.sh
```


> **Note:** The training scripts require `vllm>=0.11.0` for Qwen3-VL compatibility. However, the reward server using Qwen2.5/Qwen3 LLM may occasionally encounter issues with higher vLLM versions. We recommend running the reward server in a separate conda environment with a lower version such as `vllm==0.10.1`.

**A note on migrating CapRL to other codebases:** Our training code is built on OpenRLHF, which originally lacked VLM (e.g., Qwen3-VL) RL training support. We added VLM adaptation and CapRL's two-stage reward on top of it. If you prefer a more lightweight alternative, consider using [VeRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl), which natively supports VLM training — you only need to customize the reward computation (e.g., by querying a vLLM reward server). If there is demand for VeRL integration, please open an issue to let us know.

## Pretraining

### Datasets

Our **CapRL-2M** dataset is available on :
[🔗 Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/CapRL-2M)

It includes images from [ShareGPT-1M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lin-Chen/ShareGPT4V) and [DenseFusion-1M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/DenseFusion-1M), with high-quality captions re-annotated using CapRL-3B, totaling 2M samples.

In our JSONL files, we provide the captions along with their corresponding image paths. The images can be downloaded from ShareGPT-1M and DenseFusion-1M.



### Reproducing Pretraining Experiments

To reproduce the pretraining experiments presented in our paper:

1. **Initialize Qwen2.5-VL.**
   Follow the steps in the notebook [`initiallize_vlm_3b.ipynb`](https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap/blob/892ad0682defa37f54833c3c4284a9d9a5c3451e/grocery_file/initiallize_vlm_3b.ipynb) to set up the Qwen2.5-VL model for training.

2. **Training.**
   We use [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) for pretraining. The training scripts are provided in `Pretraining_exp/scripts/`, covering all 3 stages:
   - `Stage0_initial_align.sh` — Initial alignment with LLaVA-558K
   - `Stage1_further_pretrain.sh` — Further pretraining with CapRL-1M caption data
   - `Stage2_sft.sh` — SFT with general instruction data, Open-LLaVA-NeXT-1M



## Comparing Caption Quality via Prism Framework

We evaluate caption quality by **decoupling the traditional VQA (Visual Question Answering) task**:

1. First, a model generates a **caption** for the image.
2. Then, a **language model** answers questions based solely on the generated caption.

This approach allows us to assess the **informational quality and completeness** of the generated captions — if the language model can accurately answer visual questions based only on the caption, then the caption is likely high-quality.

The complete evaluation scripts can be found in the `Prism_Evaluation` folder, with the core implementation located in `Eval_CapRL.py`.

The Prism evaluation files are available at [CapRL-Evaluation-Files](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/CapRL-Evaluation-Files). The dataset contains `json_file/` for the evaluation JSON files and `bench_image_folder.zip` for the corresponding images.

```bash
huggingface-cli download internlm/CapRL-Evaluation-Files --repo-type dataset --local-dir CapRL-Evaluation-Files
cd CapRL-Evaluation-Files
unzip bench_image_folder.zip
```

Use the JSON files under `json_file/` as `--data-path` and pass the dataset root as `--image-root`. The image paths inside each JSON are relative to the dataset root, for example `bench_image_folder/lmm_eval_chartqa/41699051005347.png`.

```bash
python -m Eval_CapRL \
  --data-path /path/to/CapRL-Evaluation-Files/json_file/lmm_eval_chartqa.json \
  --image-root /path/to/CapRL-Evaluation-Files \
  --tag chartqa \
  ...
```


The model used for answering questions based on captions is [CapRL-Eval-3B](https://huggingface.co/internlm/CapRL-Eval-3B), which is a finetuned version of Qwen2.5-VL-3B. When dealing with tasks such as ChartQA (not multiple-choice questions), it provides more stable output formatting.

You can specify `--reward-model-path` as the path to **CapRL-Eval-3B** in `Eval_CapRL.py`.
