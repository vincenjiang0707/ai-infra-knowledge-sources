Open ASR Leaderboard: Trends and Insights with New Multilingual & Long-Form Tracks

[ASR models](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=automatic-speech-recognition&sort=trending)Most benchmarks focus on **short-form English transcription (<30s),** and overlook other important tasks, such as (1) multilingual performance and (2) model throughput, which can a be deciding factor for long-form audio like meetings and podcasts.

Over the past two years, the [ Open ASR Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hf-audio/open_asr_leaderboard) has become a standard for comparing open and closed-source models on both

**accuracy**and

**efficiency**. Recently,

**multilingual**and

**long-form transcription**tracks have been added to the leaderboard 🎉

Takeaways from 60+ models

As of 21 Nov 2025, the *Open ASR Leaderboard* compares **60+ open and closed-source models** from **18 organizations**, across **11 datasets**.

In a recent [preprint](https://hf.co/papers/2510.06961), we dive into the technical setup and highlight some key trends in modern ASR. Here are the big takeaways 👇

##

1. Conformer encoder 🤝 LLM decoder tops the charts 📈

Models combining [ Conformer encoders](https://huggingface.co/papers/2005.08100) with

**large language model (LLM) decoders**currently lead in English transcription accuracy. For example,

**NVIDIA’s**,

[Canary-Qwen-2.5B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/canary-qwen-2.5b)**IBM’s**, and

[Granite-Speech-3.3-8B](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-speech-3.3-8b)**Microsoft’s**achieve the lowest word error rates (

[Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-4-multimodal-instruct)[WER](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/en/chapter5/evaluation#word-error-rate)), showing that integrating LLM reasoning can significantly boost ASR accuracy.

💡 *Pro-tip: NVIDIA introduced Fast Conformer, a 2x faster variant of the Conformer, that is used in their Canary and Parakeet suite of models.*

2. Speed–accuracy tradeoffs ⚖️

While highly accurate, these LLM decoders tend to be **slower** than simpler approaches. On the *Open ASR Leaderboard*, efficiency is measured using *inverse real-time factor* (RTFx), where higher is better.

For even faster inference, [ CTC](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/en/chapter3/ctc#ctc-architectures) and

[decoders deliver](https://huggingface.co/papers/2304.06795)

**TDT****10–100× faster throughput**, albeit with slightly higher error rates. This makes them ideal for

**real-time**,

**offline**, or

**batch transcription**tasks (such as meetings, lectures, or podcasts).

3. Multilingual 🌍

OpenAI’s [ Whisper Large v3](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3) remains a strong multilingual baseline, supporting

**99 languages**. However,

**fine-tuned or distilled variants**like

[and](https://huggingface.co/distil-whisper/distil-large-v3.5)

**Distil-Whisper**[often outperform the original on](https://huggingface.co/nyrahealth/CrisperWhisper)

**CrisperWhisper****English-only**tasks, showing how targeted fine-tuning can improve specialization (

*how to fine-tune? Check out guides for*).

[Whisper](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter5/fine-tuning),[Parakeet](https://github.com/Deep-unlearning/Finetune-Parakeet), and[Voxtral](https://github.com/Deep-unlearning/Finetune-Voxtral-ASR)That said, focusing on English tends to **reduce multilingual coverage** 👉 a classic case of the tradeoff between specialization and generalization. Similarly, while **self-supervised** systems like Meta’s [ Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS)](https://huggingface.co/facebook/mms-1b-all) and

[can support 1K+ languages, they trail behind language-specific encoders in accuracy.](https://github.com/facebookresearch/omnilingual-asr)

**Omnilingual ASR**⭐ *While just five languages are currently benchmarked, we’re planning to expand to more languages and are excited for new dataset and models contributions to multilingual ASR through GitHub pull requests.*

🎯 Alongside multilingual benchmarks, several **community-driven leaderboards** focus on individual languages. For example, the [ Open Universal Arabic ASR Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/elmresearchcenter/open_universal_arabic_asr_leaderboard) compares models across

**Modern Standard Arabic and regional dialects**, highlighting how speech variation and diglossia challenge current systems. Similarly. the

[provides a growing hub for evaluating encoder-decoder and CTC models on](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Vikhrmodels/Russian_ASR_Leaderboard)

**Russian ASR Leaderboard****Russian-specific phonology and morphology**. These localized efforts mirror the broader multilingual leaderboard’s mission to encourage

**dataset sharing, fine-tuned checkpoints, and transparent model comparisons**, especially in languages with fewer established ASR resources.

4. Long-form transcription is a different game ⏳

For **long-form audio** (e.g., podcasts, lectures, meetings), **closed-source systems** still edge out open ones. It could be due to domain tuning, custom chunking, or production-grade optimization.

Among open models, **OpenAI’s Whisper Large v3** performs the best. But for throughput, **CTC-based Conformers** shine 👉 for example, **NVIDIA’s Parakeet CTC 1.1B** achieves an

**RTFx of 2793.75**, compared to

**68.56**for Whisper Large v3, with only a moderate WER degradation (

**6.68**and

**6.43**respectively).

The tradeoff? Parakeet is **English-only,** again reminding us of that multilingual and specialization tradeoff 🫠.

⭐ *While closed systems still lead, there’s huge potential for open-source innovation here. Long-form ASR remains one of the most exciting frontiers for the community to tackle next!*

🎤 The Show Must Go On

Given how fast ASR is evolving, we’re excited to see what new architectures push performance and efficiency, and how the *Open ASR Leaderboard* continues to serve as a **transparent, community-driven benchmark** for the field, and as a reference for other leaderboards ([Russian](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Vikhrmodels/Russian_ASR_Leaderboard), [Arabic](https://huggingface.co/spaces/elmresearchcenter/open_universal_arabic_asr_leaderboard), and [Speech DeepFake Detection](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Speech-Arena-2025/Speech-DF-Arena)).

We’ll keep expanding the *Open ASR LeaderBoard* with **more models, more languages, and more datasets** so stay tuned 👀
