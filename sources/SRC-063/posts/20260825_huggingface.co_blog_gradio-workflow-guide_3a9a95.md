Build Anything with gr.Workflow

[Update on GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/blog/blob/main/gradio-workflow-guide.md)

** gr.Workflow**, built right into Gradio, makes the pipeline

*the interface*. You describe your steps as a graph of typed nodes, and Gradio serves a drag-and-drop canvas where every node is runnable and every intermediate result is visible. The same graph is also a REST API and a one-command deploy to Hugging Face Spaces.

The best way to get the idea is to see a few workflows in action. Every app below is a live Huggingface Space you can open, run, and duplicate.

Edit an Image

Upload an image, type an edit ("turn it into a snowy winter scene", "add sunglasses", "make the car red"), and get the edited photo back. The whole app is a single node calling [Qwen-Image-Edit](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit) on Hugging Face Inference Providers.

Chain real models into a media studio

One graph, three pipelines. Start with a prompt and generate an image with [FLUX](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell), then pass it to a [background-removal Gradio Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/not-lain/background-removal) to turn it into a sticker. A topic becomes a voiceover through a [text-to-speech Gradio Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mrfakename/MeloTTS), while the same topic becomes a catchy episode title through an [LLM](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) call.

That’s one canvas, two model calls through Hugging Face [Inference Providers](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers/en/index), and two calls to Gradio Spaces.

Since this is a workflow, each of the three outputs also gets its own REST endpoint: `/sticker`

, `/voiceover`

, and `/episode_title`

. You can call any of them directly from code without opening the UI. See [Call it from code](https://huggingface.co#call-it-from-code) below for a runnable example.

Fan-out image generation in parallel

Type in one idea, and it turns into a set of generated artwork all at once: a base image from FLUX, two AI re-imaginings of that image (a soft watercolor version and a neon cyberpunk take), and a gallery title written by an LLM.

Each image is generated directly from the prompt by a model node using Inference Providers, while the title comes from an `fn`

node that calls an LLM. This is the fan-out pattern in action: one idea can feed multiple operators simultaneously, all generating in parallel.

Profile a Hugging Face dataset

Type in a Hugging Face dataset ID, such as `stanfordnlp/imdb`

or `mteb/tweet_sentiment_extraction`

, and a single input fans out to four operator nodes that analyze the dataset live using the [Datasets Server](https://huggingface.co/docs/dataset-viewer) API.

You get an overview card, a preview of the first few rows, per-column statistics, and a distribution chart, all computed independently and in parallel. That’s the power of workflows!

Run your own GPU model

Every node so far reaches out to Hugging Face. But an `fn`

node is just Python, which means it can also run a model inside the Space on a GPU.

Decorate the bound function with `@spaces.GPU`

and, when the node runs, [ZeroGPU](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-zerogpu) grabs a GPU for that call, runs the model, and releases it. We don't always need to rely on Inference Providers or existing Gradio Spaces.

Check out this demo that animates a still image using [Lightricks/LTX-Video](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video-0.9.7-distilled) loaded through Diffusers, running entirely through one node. `gr.Workflow`

doesn't need to know anything about your GPU setup. It simply calls the bound function.

[

How it works, in a nutshell

Every workflow is a graph with three kinds of nodes: **references** (your inputs), **operators** (the steps that do work), and **subjects** (your outputs). An operator can be your own Python function, a model on Hugging Face Inference Providers, another Gradio Space, or a row from a Hub dataset. You connect them by dragging between typed ports, hit Run, and watch each result appear in place.

##
[
](https://huggingface.co#call-it-from-code)
Call it from code

Every workflow you build is also an API, with no extra work. Each output becomes a REST endpoint named after its label, and you can call it from Python with the Gradio client. Here is a live, no-token example against the multi-endpoint demo Space, exactly as-is:

```
from gradio_client import Client
client = Client("ysharma/gr-workflow-multi-endpoint-API")
print(client.predict("hello there friend", api_name="/word_count")) # -> 3
print(client.predict(20, api_name="/fahrenheit")) # -> 68.0
```


Endpoints that call a model or a Space run under a Hugging Face token, so pass one when you create the client:

```
from gradio_client import Client, handle_file
client = Client("ysharma/gr-workflow-image-editor", token="hf_...")
edited = client.predict(
handle_file("dog.jpg"),
"turn it into a snowy winter scene",
api_name="/edited_image",
)
```


Prefer plain HTTP? Every endpoint is reachable over `curl`

too:

```
curl -s https://ysharma-gr-workflow-multi-endpoint-API.hf.space/gradio_api/call/word_count \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": ["hello there friend"]}'
```

Build your own

The fastest way in is to open any demo above, click **Duplicate**, and start rewiring. From Python, it is as short as:

```
import gradio as gr
def your_function(text: str) -> str:
pass
gr.Workflow(bind=[your_function]).launch()
```


For the full walkthrough, the operator kinds, the JSON schema, and reusable patterns, see the official [gr.Workflow guide](https://gradio.app/guides/workflows) in the Gradio docs.

You can even build something as involved as [AUTOMATIC1111](https://github.com/automatic1111/stable-diffusion-webui) with `gr.Workflow`

. Keep an eye out for our next post, where we walk through building it step by step. Here is a sneak peek 😉👇
