DeepMath: A lightweight math reasoning Agent with smolagents

[Update on GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/blog/blob/main/intel-deepmath.md)


*By Intel AI Software Group*

[DeepMath](https://huggingface.co/Intel/deepmath-v1) is an aligned math reasoning agent built on ** Qwen3-4B Thinking** and fine-tuned with

**GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**. Instead of verbose text, the model emits

**tiny Python snippets**for intermediate steps, runs them in a secure sandbox, and folds the results back into its reasoning, reducing errors and output length. The agent is implemented using the

**.**

[smolagents library](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)We evaluate DeepMath on four math datasets: ** MATH500, AIME, HMMT, and HLE,** and show that:

🤖 The math agent alone reduces output lengths by up to 66%, while often improving accuracy.

⚡ GRPO training improves the agent performance even further, in almost all benchmarks.

Why DeepMath?

Large language models (LLMs) have advanced reasoning capabilities, but mathematical problem-solving remains challenging; chain-of-thought traces can be lengthy and prone to arithmetic mistakes. Recent works[^1][^2] demonstrate that small models can reach strong performance, and other studies[^3] investigate tool use to improve reliability. What those papers generally do not emphasize is reducing trace verbosity or explicitly training models to prefer short, computation-oriented traces executed in a constrained, auditable environment.

We focused on two goals:

**Offload deterministic computation**to a safe executor.**Train models to prefer concise, computation-oriented traces**over verbose text.

**DeepMath** tackles this by combining a small Python executor with a fine-tuned LLM, enabling concise, computation-driven reasoning. The model learns to generate short Python snippets, which are executed in a sandbox and reintegrated into the context. GRPO fine-tuning encourages this behavior by rewarding correctness and encouraging shorter outputs.

How It Works

- Base model:
[Qwen3-4B Thinking](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507). - Executor constraints: sandboxed environment, allow-list of imported modules, per-snippet timeout.
- Inference: based on
[smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/), a math agent was created.[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vLLM)is used as the inference engine. - Training: based on the GRPO trainer in
[TRL](https://github.com/huggingface/trl), we modified TRL's vLLM client and server to generate GRPO completions using our DeepMath agent.


*Figure 1: The vLLM client and server were modified to use the DeepMath agent in generating the candidates, while using the vLLM backend.*

**Agent Interface:**During inference, the model can output normal tokens or special agent calls containing Python snippets.**Execution:**Snippets run in a sandboxed environment with strict safety constraints (no file I/O, no network, timeouts).**Design Goals:****Concision:**Replace multi-line textual calculations with short, focused snippets.**Determinism & Safety:**Enforce strict execution limits.**Interpretability:**Snippets are readable and auditable.

Training with GRPO

We fine-tune the model using **GRPO**, a reward-based optimization that balances:

**Accuracy Reward:**+1 for correct answers.**Using code snippets:**+1 for generating code snippets, weighted 10:1 vs. the accuracy reward.**Length reduction:**shorter lengths are encouraged by limiting the GRPO completion candidates to 5k tokens.**Temperature Scheduling:**We implemented linear temperature scheduling (T=1.2 → T=0.7) to balance exploration and stability during training. This approach aims to enhance experimentation during the initial training phases, subsequently reducing the temperature as we refine our proficiency in the skill.**In-context Learning**: we include 4 solved examples where the trace contains agent calls and executor outputs, so the model learns the syntax and the call/response pattern.**Dataset**: we used the Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) subset of the[OpenMathReasoning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenMathReasoning)dataset. Note that GRPO only uses the__problem__, not the solution in the data. This dataset was chosen to ensure the problems benefit from the external tool.

Evaluation

We benchmarked DeepMath against baselines on four datasets. Metrics include:

**majority@16**: robustness across samples, as used in previous math reasoning works, see references.**Mean output length**: brevity.


We compare a baseline configuration (

[Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507), no agenting) with our DeepMath model. As ablation, we evaluate the agentic framework we developed running with the untrained Qwen3 model, denoted by**+Agent**. Additionally, we examine whether the GRPO training (for agentic use) improves non-agentic inference, denoted by**+GRPO**. Thus the two ablations are independent, not additive.We observe the agentic inference reduces output lengths, with mixed accuracy results. The DeepMath model is both GRPO-trained and run in agentic mode, and shows the highest accuracy with shortened traces. We conclude

**both GRPO training and agentic inference are needed**for best results.

**Key Insight:** DeepMath reduces output length by up to **66%** while improving accuracy on challenging datasets.

Why It Matters

**Accuracy:**Offloading computation reduces arithmetic errors.**Efficiency:**Shorter outputs mean faster inference and easier interpretability.**Safety:**Sandbox execution mitigates risks of running arbitrary code.

Conclusion

DeepMath demonstrates a practical and lightweight way to combine a small executor with an LLM and to train the model to prefer short, computation-driven traces. Offloading deterministic computation reduces arithmetic and numerical errors and shortens traces, and GRPO fine-tuning further encourages concise, correct answers. The result is a more accurate and more interpretable math-solving agent without requiring a massive model or heavyweight external tools.

Limitations & Future Work

**Scope**: we focused on a small model and on mathematical reasoning.**Generalization**: evaluated on contest-style math; results may not transfer to open-ended mathematical creativity or formal proofs.Executing generated code is inherently risky. DeepMath uses strict sandboxing and resource limits, but any deployment should carefully manage attack surfaces and enforce rate limits.
