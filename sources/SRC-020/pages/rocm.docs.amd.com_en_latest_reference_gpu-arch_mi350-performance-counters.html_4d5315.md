# MI350 Series performance counters[#](https://rocm.docs.amd.com#mi350-series-performance-counters)

This topic lists and describes the hardware performance counters and derived metrics available on the AMD Instinct MI350 and MI355 GPUs. These counters are available for profiling using [ROCprofiler-SDK](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/index.html) and [ROCm Compute Profiler](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-compute/en/latest/).
