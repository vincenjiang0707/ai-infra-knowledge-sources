# 1. Installation and Troubleshooting Guide[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#installation-and-troubleshooting-guide)

This guide describes how to install, debug, and isolate the performance and functional problems that are related to GDS and is intended for systems administrators and developers.

# 2. Introduction[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#introduction)

This guide describes how to debug and isolate the NVIDIA® Magnum IO GPUDirect® Storage (GDS) related performance and functional problems and is intended for systems administrators and developers.

GDS enables a direct data path for direct memory access (DMA) transfers between GPU memory and storage, which avoids a bounce buffer through the CPU. This direct path increases system bandwidth and decreases the latency and utilization load on the CPU.

Creating this direct path involves distributed file systems such as NFSoRDMA, DDN EXAScaler parallel file system solutions (based on the Lustre file system), Amazon FSx for Lustre, and WekaFS, so the GDS environment is composed of multiple software and hardware components. This guide addresses questions related to the GDS installation and helps you triage functionality and performance issues. For non-GDS issues, contact the respective OEM or file systems vendor to understand and debug the issue.

# 3. Installing GPUDirect Storage[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#installing-gpudirect-storage)

This section includes GDS installation, uninstallation, and configuration information.

Note

For NVAIE and vGPU environments, please follow steps from their respective documents.

## 3.1. Before You Install GDS[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#before-you-install-gds)

To install GDS on a non-DGX platform, complete the following steps.

Check the current IOMMU status on x86 platforms.

Note

This step can be skipped on ARM platforms.

$ journalctl -k -b | grep -i iommu

On a system where IOMMU is enabled, you will see similar lines below:

iommu: Default domain type: Translated iommu: DMA domain TLB invalidation policy: lazy mode pci 0000:XX:YY.Z: AMD-Vi: IOMMU performance counters supported pci 0000:XX:YY.Z: Adding to iommu group 0 pci 0000:XX:YY.Z: Adding to iommu group 1 pci 0000:XX:YY.Z: Adding to iommu group 2

If IOMMU is enabled, disable it as described in the next step. Otherwise, continue to the storage transport requirements.

Disable IOMMU on x86 platforms, if required.

Note

In our experience,

`iommu=off`

provides the best functionality and performance. On certain platforms, such as DGX A100 and DGX-2,`iommu=pt`

is supported.`iommu=on`

is not guaranteed to work functionally or performantly.Open the GRUB configuration file.

$ sudo vi /etc/default/grub

Add one of the following options to the

`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`

option:For AMD CPUs, add

`amd_iommu=off`

.For Intel CPUs, add

`intel_iommu=off`

.

If other options are already present, separate the options with a space. For example:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="console=tty0 amd_iommu=off"

Update GRUB and reboot the system.

$ sudo update-grub $ sudo reboot

After the system reboots, verify that the change took effect.

$ journalctl -k -b | grep -i iommu

On a system where IOMMU is disabled, you will see similar lines below:

Command line: ... amd_iommu=off ... Kernel command line: ... amd_iommu=off ... iommu: Default domain type: Translated iommu: DMA domain TLB invalidation policy: lazy mode (...no groups)

Review the storage transport requirements.

Additional software is required only if you need to enable support for NVMe, NVMe over Fabrics, or NFS over RDMA.

To install MLNX_OFED, see

[MLNX_OFED Requirements and Installation](https://docs.nvidia.com#mofed-req-install).To install DOCA, see

[DOCA Requirements and Installation](https://docs.nvidia.com#doca-requirements-and-installation).

This step is not required for DGX OS 6.x or later.

Disable PCIe ACS, if required.

For best GPUDirect Storage (GDS) performance, disable PCIe ACS at boot. Add the following parameters to

`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`

in`/etc/default/grub`

, preserving any existing parameters:GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="console=tty0 pci=disable_acs_redir=pci:0:0 dyndbg=\"file drivers/pci/pci.c +p\""

After editing the file, regenerate the GRUB configuration using the command appropriate for the operating system, then reboot.

$ sudo update-grub $ sudo reboot

After the system reboots, verify that the change took effect.

$ journalctl -k -b | grep -i 'acs'

You should observe the following lines:

Command line: ... pci=disable_acs_redir=pci:0:0 ... Kernel command line: ... pci=disable_acs_redir=pci:0:0 ... pcieport 0000:XX:YY.Z: Configured ACS to 0x0000


## 3.2. Installing GDS[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#installing-gds)

GDS installation is supported in two ways:

using package managers such as Debian and RPMs


For installation on DGX platforms, refer to:

For installation on non-DGX platforms:

Starting in CUDA Toolkit 13.4,

`nvidia-fs`

must be installed separately by following the platform-specific instructions on the[NVIDIA nvidia-fs downloads page](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-fs-downloads).The cuFile user-space libraries and GDS tools are still distributed as part of the CUDA Toolkit.


Additional information about CUDA Toolkit installation is in the
[CUDA Installation Guide for Linux](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html).

Throughout this document, in `cuda-<x>.<y>`

, `x`

refers to the CUDA major version and `y`

refers to the minor version.

### 3.2.1. Configuring File System Settings for GDS[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#configuring-file-system-settings-for-gds)

Before proceeding, please refer to the File System specific section in this document for necessary configurations needed to support GDS:

Lustre-Lnet:

[Configuring LNet Networks with Multiple OSTs for Optimal Peer Selection](https://docs.nvidia.com#multi-osts-peer-sel)WekaIO:

[GDS Configuration File Changes to Support the WekaIO File System](https://docs.nvidia.com#gds-config-file-changes)IBM Spectrum Scale:

[GDS Configuration to Support IBM Spectrum Scale](https://docs.nvidia.com#gds-configs-to-support-spectrum-scale)VAST:

[Set Up the Networking](https://docs.nvidia.com#networking-setup)EXT4/XFS:

[Mounting a Local File System for GDS](https://docs.nvidia.com#mounting-a-local-filesystem-for-gds)

### 3.2.2. Verifying a Successful GDS Installation[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#verifying-a-successful-gds-installation)

To verify that GDS installation was successful, run `gdscheck`

:

```
$ /usr/local/cuda-<x>.<y>/gds/tools/gdscheck.py -p
```

Note

The `gdscheck`

command expects python3 to be present on the system. If it fails because of python3 not being
available, then you can invoke the command with the explicit path to where python (i.e. python3) is installed. For example:

`$ /usr/bin/python /usr/local/cuda-<x>.<y>/gds/tools/gdscheck.py -p`


The output of this command shows whether a supported file system or device installed on the system supports GDS. The output also shows whether PCIe ACS is enabled on any of the PCI switches.

Sample output:

There are READMEs provided in `/usr/local/cuda-<x>.<y>/gds/tools`

and `/usr/local/cuda-<x>.<y>/gds/samples`

to show usage.

## 3.3. Installed GDS Libraries and Tools[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#installed-gds-libraries-and-tools)

GPUDirect Storage userspace libraries are located in the `/usr/local/cuda-<X>.<Y>/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/`

directory.

Note

GPUDirect Storage packages are installed at `/usr/local/cuda-X.Y/gds`

, where **X** is the major version of the
CUDA toolkit, and **Y** is the minor version.

```
$ ls -1 /usr/local/cuda-X.Y/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/*cufile*
cufile.h
libcufile.so
libcufile.so.0
libcufile.so.1.0.0

drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K mar 19 10:28 tools
```

For this release, GPUDirect Storage is providing an additional `libcufile-dev`

package (cuFile library
developers package) . This is primarily intended for the developer’s environment. Essentially the
`libcufile-dev`

package contains a static version of cuFile library (`libcufile_static.a`

, `libcufile_rdma_static.a`

)
and `cufile.h`

header file which may be required by the applications that use cuFile library APIs.

## 3.4. Uninstalling GPUDirect Storage[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#uninstalling-gpudirect-storage)

To uninstall GDS from Ubuntu and DGX OS:

```
$ sudo apt-get remove --purge "*libcufile*" "*gds-tools*" "*nvidia-fs*"
```

To uninstall from RHEL:

```
$ sudo dnf remove "nvidia-gds*"
```

## 3.5. Environment Variables Used by GPUDirect Storage[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#environment-variables-used-by-gpudirect-storage)

GDS uses the following environment variables.

CUFILE_ENV Variable |
Description |
|---|---|
|
Completion queue depth for the DC target. |
|
Controls whether cufile checks for supporting file systems. When set to 1, allows testing with new file systems that are not yet officially enabled with cuFile. |
|
The path to an additional |
|
Sets QOS level on RoCEv2 device QP for userspace RDMA targets (WekaFS and GPFS). |
|
Sets QOS level on IB device QP for userspace RDMA targets (WekaFS and GPFS). |
|
Controls the path for cuFile log information. Specifies the default log path, which is the current working directory of the application. Useful for containers or logging. |
|
Controls the tracing level and can override the trace level for a specific application without requiring a new configuration file. |
|
Minimum RNR value for QP after which the QP will error out with RNR timeout if no Work Request is posted on the remote end. Default value is 16 (2.56ms). |
|
DEPRECATED |
|
Controls the DC_KEY for userspace RDMA DC targets for WekaFS and GPFS. |
|
Maximum number of hops before the packet is discarded on the network. Prevents indefinite looping of the packet. Default is 64. |
|
Partition key index. |
|
Maximum number of Work requests supported by the Shared Request Queue. |
|
Maximum number of Scatter Gather Entries supported per Work Request. |
|
Setting this environment variable to true will skip topology detection in compat mode. This will reduce the high startup latency seen in compat mode on systems with multiple PCI devices. |
|
Overrides cufile.json settings and forces I/O to go through compatible mode instead of GDS mode. |
|
This does exactly what the |

## 3.6. JSON Config Parameters Used by GPUDirect Storage[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#json-config-parameters-used-by-gpudirect-storage)

Refer to [GPUDirect Storage Parameters](https://docs.nvidia.com/gpudirect-storage/configuration-guide/index.html#gpudirect-storage-parameters) for details about
the JSON Config parameters used by GDS.

Consider `compat_mode`

for systems or mounts that are not yet set up with GDS support. To learn more about
Compatibility Mode, refer to [cuFile Compatibility Mode](https://docs.nvidia.com/gpudirect-storage/api-reference-guide/index.html#cufile-compatibility-mode).

## 3.7. GDS Configuration File Changes to Support Dynamic Routing[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gds-configuration-file-changes-to-support-dynamic-routing)

For dynamic routing to support multiple file systems and mount points, configure the global per-file system
`rdma_dev_addr_list`

property for a single mount or the `rdma_dev_addr_list`

property for a per file system mount table. This feature is to tune and restrict which NICs are available for cuFile to utilize.

```
"fs": {
"lustre": {
// if using a single lustre mount, provide the ip addresses
// here (use : sudo lnetctl net show)
//"rdma_dev_addr_list" : []
// if using multiple lustre mounts, provide ip addresses
// used by respective mount here
//"mount_table" : {
// "/lustre/ai200_01/client" : {
// "rdma_dev_addr_list" : ["172.172.1.40",
"172.172.1.42"]
// },
// "/lustre/ai200_02/client" : {
// "rdma_dev_addr_list" : ["172.172.2.40",
"172.172.2.42"]
//}
},
"nfs": {
//"rdma_dev_addr_list" : []
//"mount_table" : {
// "/mnt/nfsrdma_01/" : {
// "rdma_dev_addr_list" : []
//},
// "/mnt/nfsrdma_02/" : {
// "rdma_dev_addr_list" : []
//}
//}
},
},
```

## 3.8. Determining Which Version of GDS is Installed[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#determining-which-version-of-gds-is-installed)

To determine which version of GDS you have, run the following command:

```
$ gdscheck.py -v
```

Example output:

```
GDS release version: 1.0.0.78
nvidia_fs version: 2.7 libcufile version: 2.4
```

# 4. API Errors[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#api-errors)

This section provides information about the common API errors you might get when using GDS.

## 4.1. CU_FILE_DRIVER_NOT_INITIALIZED[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cu-file-driver-not-initialized)

If the `cuFileDriverOpen`

API is not called, errors encountered in the implicit call to driver initialization
are reported as cuFile errors encountered when calling `cuFileBufRegister`

or `cuFileHandleRegister`

.

## 4.2. CU_FILE_DEVICE_NOT_SUPPORTED[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cu-file-device-not-supported)

GDS is supported only on NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPU) Tesla® or Quadro® models that support compute mode, and a compute major capability greater than or equal to 6.

Note

This includes V100 and T4 cards.

## 4.3. CU_FILE_IO_NOT_SUPPORTED[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cu-file-io-not-supported)

If the file descriptor is from a local file system, or a mount that is not GDS ready, the API returns
the `CU_FILE_IO_NOT_SUPPORTED`

error.

Refer to [Before You Install GDS](https://docs.nvidia.com#install-prereqs) for a list of the supported file systems.

Common reasons for this error include:

The file descriptor belongs to an unsupported file system.

The specified

`fd`

is not a regular UNIX file.Any combination of encryption, and compression, compliance settings on the

`fd`

are set.For example,

`FS_COMPR_FL | FS_ENCRYPT_FL | FS_APPEND_FL | FS_IMMUTABLE_FL`

.Note

These settings are allowed when

`compat_mode`

is set to`true`

.Any combination of unsupported file modes are specified in the open call for the

`fd`

. For example,O_APPEND | O_NOCTTY | O_NONBLOCK | O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW | O_TMPFILE


## 4.4. CU_FILE_CUDA_MEMORY_TYPE_INVALID[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cu-file-cuda-memory-type-invalid)

Physical memory for `cudaMallocManaged`

memory is allocated dynamically at the first use. Currently, it does not
provide a mechanism to expose physical memory or Base Address Register (BAR) memory to pin for use in GDS. However,
GDS indirectly supports `cudaMallocManaged`

memory when the memory is used as an unregistered buffer with
`cuFileWrite`

and `cuFileRead`

.

# 5. Basic Troubleshooting[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#basic-troubleshooting)

## 5.1. Log Files for the GDS Library[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#log-files-for-the-gds-library)

A `cufile.log`

file is created in the current working directory of the application. Currently the default
maximum log file size is 32MB. If the log file size increases to greater than 32MB, the log file is truncated
and logging is resumed on the same file. This limit is configurable through the setting in the logging section of `cufile.json`

or the environment variable; setting it to a larger value raises the truncation threshold, and setting it to `-1`

removes the limit entirely so the log file grows unbounded (recommended only for short debugging runs).

## 5.2. Enabling a Different cufile.log File for Each Application[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#enabling-a-different-cufile-log-file-for-each-application)

You can enable a different `cufile.log`

file for each application.

There are several relevant cases:

If the

`logging:dir`

property in the default /etc/cufile.json file is not set, by default, the`cufile.log`

file is generated in the current working directory of the application.If the

`logging:dir`

property is set in the default`/etc/cufile.json`

file, the log file is created in the specified directory path.

Note

This is usually not recommended for scenarios where multiple applications use the `libcufile.so`

library.

For example:

```
"logging": {
// log directory, if not enabled
// will create log file under current working
// directory
"dir": "/opt/gdslogs/",
}
```

The `cufile.log`

will be created as a `/opt/gdslogs/cufile.log`

file.

If the application needs to enable a different `cufile.log`

for different applications, the application can
override the default JSON path by doing the following steps:

Export CUFILE_ENV_PATH_JSON=”/opt/myapp/cufile.json”.

Edit the /opt/myapp/cufile.json file.

"logging": { // log directory, if not enabled // will create log file under current working // directory "dir": "/opt/myapp", }

Run the application.

To check for logs, run:

$ ls -l /opt/myapp/cufile.log


## 5.3. Enabling Tracing GDS Library API Calls[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#enabling-tracing-gds-library-api-calls)

There are different logging levels, which can be enabled in the `/etc/cufile.json`

file.

By default, logging level is set to `ERROR`

. Logging will have performance impact as we increase the verbosity
levels like `INFO`

, `DEBUG`

, and `TRACE`

, and should be enabled only to debug field issues.

Configure tracing and run the following:

```
"logging": {
// log directory, if not enabled
// will create log file under local directory
//"dir": "/home/<xxxx>",
// ERROR|WARN|INFO|DEBUG|TRACE (in decreasing order of priority)
"level": "ERROR"
},
```

## 5.4. cuFileHandleRegister Error[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufilehandleregister-error)

If you see the `cuFileHandleRegister`

error on the `cufile.log`

file when an IO is issued:

```
"cuFileHandleRegister error: GPUDirect Storage not supported on current file."
```

Here are some reasons why this error might occur:

The file system is not supported by GDS.

Refer to

[CU_FILE_DEVICE_NOT_SUPPORTED](https://docs.nvidia.com#cu-file-device-not-supported)for more information.`DIRECT_IO`

functionality is not supported for the mount on which the file resides.

For more information, enable tracing in the `/etc/cufile.json`

file.

## 5.5. Troubleshooting Applications that Return cuFile Errors[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#troubleshooting-applications-that-return-cufile-errors)

To troubleshoot cuFile errors:

See the

`cufile.h`

file for more information about errors that are returned by the API.If the IO was submitted to the GDS driver, check whether there are any errors in GDS stats.

If the IO fails, the error stats should provide information about the type of error.

See

[Finding GDS Driver Statistics](https://docs.nvidia.com#find-driver-stats)for more information.Enable GDS library tracing and monitor the

`cufile.log`

file.Enable GDS Driver debugging:

$ echo 1 >/sys/module/nvidia_fs/parameters/dbg_enabled


After the driver debug logs are enabled, you might get more information about the error.

## 5.6. cuFile-* Errors with No Activity in GPUDirect Storage Statistics[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-errors-with-no-activity-in-gpudirect-storage-statistics)

If there are cuFile errors in the GDS statistics, this means that the API failed in the GDS library. You can
enable tracing by setting the appropriate logging level in the /etc/cufile.json file to get more information
about the failure in `cufile.log`

.

## 5.7. CUDA Runtime and Driver Mismatch with Error Code 35[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-runtime-and-driver-mismatch-with-error-code-35)

Error code 35 from the CUDA documentation points to `cudaErrorInsufficientDriver`

, which indicates that the installed
NVIDIA CUDA driver is older than the CUDA runtime library. This is not a supported configuration. For the application to
run, you must update the NVIDIA display driver.

Note

cuFile tools depend on CUDA runtime 10.1 and later. You must ensure that the installed CUDA runtime is compatible with the installed CUDA driver and is at the recommended version.

## 5.8. CUDA API Errors when Running the cuFile-* APIs[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-api-errors-when-running-the-cufile-apis)

The GDS library uses the CUDA driver APIs.

If you observe CUDA API errors, you will observe an error code. Refer to the error codes in the
[CUDA Libraries documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/doc/index.html#math-libraries) for more information.

## 5.9. Finding GDS Driver Statistics[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#finding-gds-driver-statistics)

To find the GDS Driver Statistics, run the following command:

```
$ cat /proc/driver/nvidia-fs/stats
```

GDS Driver kernel statistics for `READ`

/ `WRITE`

are available for all file systems except for Weka. For Weka file
system statistics, refer to [WekaFS Troubleshooting](https://docs.nvidia.com#trouble-faq-wekafs) for more information about `READ`

/ `WRITE`

.

Note

Compatibility mode and P2PDMA I/O statistics are not tracked.

## 5.10. Tracking IO Activity that Goes Through the GDS Driver[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#tracking-io-activity-that-goes-through-the-gds-driver)

In GDS Driver statistics, the **ops** row shows the active IO operation. The `Read`

and `Write`

fields show the
current active operation in flight. This information should provide an idea of how many total IOs are in flight
across all applications in the kernel. If there is a bottleneck in the userspace, the number of active IOs will
be less than the number of threads that are submitting the IO. Additionally, to get more details about the `Read`

and `Write`

bandwidth numbers, look out for counters in the `Read`

/`Write`

rows.

## 5.11. Read/Write Bandwidth and Latency Numbers in GDS Stats[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#read-write-bandwidth-and-latency-numbers-in-gds-stats)

Measured latencies begin when the IO is submitted and end when the IO completion is received by the GDS kernel driver. Userspace latencies are not reported. This should provide an idea whether the user space is bottlenecked or whether the IO is bottlenecked on the backend disks/fabric.

Note

The WekaIO file system reads do not go through the nvidia-fs driver, so `Read`

/`Write`

bandwidth
stats are not available for WekaIO file system by using this interface.

Refer to the [WekaFS Troubleshooting](https://docs.nvidia.com#trouble-faq-wekafs) for more information.

## 5.12. Tracking Registration and Deregistration of GPU Buffers[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#tracking-registration-and-deregistration-of-gpu-buffers)

In GDS Driver stats, look for the active field in BAR1-map stats row.

The pinning and unpinning of GPU memory through `cuFileBufRegister`

and `cuFileBufDeregister`

is an expensive
operation. If you notice a large number of `registrations(n)`

and `deregistration(free)`

in the nvidia-fs stats,
it can hurt performance. Refer to the [GPUDirect Storage Best Practices Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/gpudirect-storage/best-practices-guide/index.html)
for more information about using the `cuFileBufRegister`

API.

## 5.13. Enabling RDMA-specific Logging for Userspace File Systems[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#enabling-rdma-specific-logging-for-userspace-file-systems)

In order to troubleshoot RDMA related issues for userspace file systems, ensure that the `CUFILE_LOGGING_LEVEL`

environment variable is set to `INFO`

, `DEBUG`

, or `TRACE`

prior to running the application. However, for
this to work, `cufile.json`

logging level also should be set to `TRACE/DEBUG/INFO`

level.

For example:

## 5.14. CUDA_ERROR_SYSTEM_NOT_READY After Installation[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-error-system-not-ready-after-installation)

On systems with NVSwitch, if you notice the CUDA_ERROR_SYSTEM_NOT_READY error being reported, then make sure that you install the same version of Fabric Manager as the CUDA driver.

For example, if you use:

```
$ sudo apt install nvidia-driver-460-server -y
```

then use:

```
$ apt-get install nvidia-fabricmanager-460
```

Make sure to restart the Fabric Manager service using:

```
$ sudo service nvidia-fabricmanager start
```

## 5.15. Adding udev Rules for RAID Volumes[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#adding-udev-rules-for-raid-volumes)

To add udev rules for RAID volumes:

As a sudo user, change the following line in `/lib/udev/rules.d/63-md-raid-arrays.rules`

:

```
IMPORT{program}="/usr/sbin/mdadm --detail --export $devnode"
```

Reboot the node or restart the `mdadm`

.

## 5.16. When You Observe “Incomplete write” on NVME Drives[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#when-you-observe-incomplete-write-on-nvme-drives)

During GDS mode writes, you may receive error messages similar to the following:

```
Tid: 0 incomplete Write, done = 0 issued = 1048576
```

GPUDirect storage in P2P mode does not support NVMe end to end data protection features. To support GDS in
P2P mode, the NVMe must be formatted with Protection Information - `Metadata Size`

is set to zero bytes.

Confirm that the drive has data-integrity mode enabled:

```
$ sudo nvme id-ns /dev/nvme0n1 -H
-
LBA Format 0 : Metadata Size: 0 bytes - Data Size: 512 bytes - Relative Performance: 0x1 Better
LBA Format 1 : Metadata Size: 8 bytes - Data Size: 512 bytes - Relative Performance: 0x3 Degraded (in use)
LBA Format 2 : Metadata Size: 0 bytes - Data Size: 4096 bytes - Relative Performance: 0 Best
LBA Format 3 : Metadata Size: 8 bytes - Data Size: 4096 bytes - Relative Performance: 0x2 Good
LBA Format 4 : Metadata Size: 64 bytes - Data Size: 4096 bytes - Relative Performance: 0x3 Degraded
```

Note in the preceding example, the metadata size of the drive (nvme0n1) is set to non-zero.

You can set the LBA format to 0 or 2 to disable the protection feature on the drive:

```
$ sudo nvme format /dev/nvme0n1 -l 2
$ sudo nvme id-ns /dev/nvme0n1 -H
-
LBA Format 0 : Metadata Size: 0 bytes - Data Size: 512 bytes - Relative Performance: 0x1 Better
LBA Format 1 : Metadata Size: 8 bytes - Data Size: 512 bytes - Relative Performance: 0x3 Degraded
LBA Format 2 : Metadata Size: 0 bytes - Data Size: 4096 bytes - Relative Performance: 0 Best (in use)
LBA Format 3 : Metadata Size: 8 bytes - Data Size: 4096 bytes - Relative Performance: 0x2 Good
LBA Format 4 : Metadata Size: 64 bytes - Data Size: 4096 bytes - Relative Performance: 0x3 Degraded
```

## 5.17. CUFILE async I/O is failing[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-async-i-o-is-failing)

There could be many reasons for which stream based async I/O can fail. This will be logged in `cufile.log`

. One of
the common reasons could be that the internal thread pool is not enabled. Refer to `cufile.json`

“execution” section
on how to enable it.

# 6. Advanced Troubleshooting[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#advanced-troubleshooting)

This section provides information about troubleshooting some advanced issues.

## 6.1. Resolving Hung cuFile* APIs with No Response[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#resolving-hung-cufile-apis-with-no-response)

To resolve hung cuFile APIs:

Check whether there are any kernel panics/warnings in

`dmesg`

:$ dmesg > warnings.txt. less warnings.txt

Check whether the application process is in the

`D`

(uninterruptible) state.If the process is in the

`D`

state:Get the PID of the process by running the following command:

$ ps axf | grep ' D'

As a root user, get the backtrace of the

`D`

state process:$ su root $ cat /proc/<pid>/stack


Verify whether the threads are stuck in the kernel or in user space. For more information, review the backtrace of the

`D`

state threads.Check whether any threads are showing heavy CPU usage.

The

`htop`

and`mpstat`

tools should show CPU usage per core.Get the call graph of where the CPUs are being used. The following code snippet should narrow down whether the threads are hung in user space or in the kernel:

$ perf top -g



## 6.2. Sending Relevant Data to Customer Support[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#sending-relevant-data-to-customer-support)

This section describes how to resolve a kernel panic with stack traces using NVSM or the GDS Log Collection tool.

**DGX OS:**

For DGX BaseOS with the preview network repo enabled and NVSM installed:

```
$ sudo apt-get install nvsm
$ sudo nvsm dump health
```

For more details on running NVSM commands, refer to [NVIDIA System Management User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/nvsm/nvsm-user-guide/index.html#topic_3_4_3).

**Non DGX:**

The GDS Log Collection tool, `gds_log_collection.py`

, may be run by GDS users to collect relevant debugging
information from the system when issues with GDS IO are seen.

Some of the important information that this tool captures is highlighted below:

dmesg Output and relevant kernel log files.

System map files and vmlinux image

modinfo output for relevant modules

`/proc/cmdline`

outputIB devices info like ibdev2net and ibstatus

OS distribution information

Cpuinfo, meminfo

nvidia-fs stats

Per process information like

`cufile.log`

,`cufile.json`

,`gds_stats`

, stack pointersAny user specified files


To use the log collection tool:

```
$ sudo /usr/local/cuda/gds//tools/gdstools/gds_log_collection.py -h
```

This tool is used to collect logs from the system that are relevant for debugging.

It collects logs such as OS and kernel info, nvidia-fs stats, dmesg logs, syslogs, system map files and per-process
logs such as `cufile.json`

, `cufile.log`

, gdsstats, process stack, and so on.

Usage:

`./gds_log_collection.py [options]`


Options:

`-h`

help

`-f file1,file2,..`

(Note: there should be no spaces between ‘,’)

These files could be any relevant files apart from the one’s being collected (such as crash files).

Usage examples:

`sudo ./gds_log_colection.py`

- Collects all the relevant logs.

`sudo ./gds_log_colection.py -f file1,file2`

- Collects all the relevant files as well as the user specified files.

## 6.3. Resolving an IO Failure with EIO and Stack Trace Warning[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#resolving-an-io-failure-with-eio-and-stack-trace-warning)

You might see an IO failure with EIO and a warning with a stack trace with an `nvfs_mgroup_check_and_set`

function in the trace.

This could mean that the EXAScaler file system did not honor `O_DIRECT`

and fell back to page cache mode.
GDS tracks this information in the driver and returns EIO.

Note

The **WARNING** stack trace is observed only once during the lifetime of the kernel module. You will get
an `Error: Input/Output (EIO)`

, but the trace message will be printed only once. If you consistently
experience this issue, contact support.

## 6.4. Controlling GPU BAR Memory Usage[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#controlling-gpu-bar-memory-usage)

To show how much BAR Memory is available per GPU, run the following command:

$ /usr/local/cuda-x.y/gds/tools/gdscheck

Review the output, for example:


```
GPU INFO:
GPU Index: 0 bar:1 bar size (MB):32768
GPU Index: 1 bar:1 bar size (MB):32768
```

GDS uses BAR memory in the following cases:

When the process invokes

`cuFileBufRegister`

.When GDS uses the cache internally to allocate bounce buffers per GPU.


Note

There is no per-GPU configuration for cache and BAR memory usage.

Each process can control the usage of BAR memory via the configurable property in the `/etc/cufile.json`

file:

```
"properties": {
// device memory size for reserving bounce buffers for the entire GPU (in KB)
"max_device_cache_size" : 131072,
// limit on maximum memory that can be pinned for a given process (in KB)
"max_device_pinned_mem_size" : 33554432
}
.. note::
This configuration is per process, and the configuration is set across all GPUs.
```

## 6.5. Determining the Amount of Cache to Set Aside[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#determining-the-amount-of-cache-to-set-aside)

By default, 128 MB of cache is set in the configurable `max_device_cache_size`

property. However, this does not
mean that GDS pre-allocates 128 MB of memory per GPU up front. Memory allocation is done on the fly and is based
on need. After the allocation is complete, there is no purging of the cache.

By default, since 128 MB is set, the cache can grow up to 128 MB. Setting the cache is application specific and
depends on workload. Refer to the [GPUDirect Storage Best Practices Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/gpudirect-storage/best-practices-guide/index.html)
to understand the need of cache and how to set the limit based on guidance in the guide.

## 6.6. Monitoring BAR Memory Usage[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#monitoring-bar-memory-usage)

There is no way to monitor the BAR memory usage per process. However, GDS Stats tracks the global BAR usage across
all processes. For more information, see the following stat output from `/proc/driver/nvidia_fs/stats`

for the
GPU with `B:D:F 0000:34:00.0`

:

```
GPU 0000:34:00.0 uuid:12a86a5e-3002-108f-ee49-4b51266cdc07 : Registered_MB=32 Cache_MB=10
```

`Registered_MB`

tracks how much BAR memory is used when applications are explicitly using the `cuFileBufRegister`

API.

`Cache_MB`

tracks GDS usage of BAR memory for internal cache.

## 6.7. Resolving an ENOMEM Error Code[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#resolving-an-enomem-error-code)

`-12`

ENOMEM error code.

Each GPU has some BAR memory reserved. The `cuFileBufRegister`

function makes the pages that underlie a range of
GPU virtual memory accessible to a third-party device. This process is completed by pinning the GPU device memory
in BAR space by using the `nvidia_p2p_get_pages`

API. If the application tries to pin memory beyond the available
BAR space, the `nvidia_p2p_get_pages`

API returns a `-12`

(ENOMEM) error code.

To avoid running out of BAR memory, developers should use this output to manage how much memory is pinned by application. Administrators can use this output to investigate how to limit the pinned memory for different applications.

## 6.8. GDS and Compatibility Mode[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gds-and-compatibility-mode)

To determine the GDS compatibility mode, complete the following:

In the /etc/cufile.json file, verify that

`allow_compat_mode`

is set to`true`

.`gdscheck -p`

displays whether the`allow_compat_mode`

property is set to`true`

.Check the

`cufile.log`

file for the`cufile IO mode: POSIX`

message.This message is in the hot IO path, where logging each instance significantly impacts performance, so the message is only logged when

`logging:level`

is explicitly set to the`TRACE`

mode in the`/etc/cufile.json`

file.

## 6.9. Enabling Compatibility Mode[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#enabling-compatibility-mode)

Compatibility mode can be used by application developers to test the applications with cuFile-enabled libraries under the following conditions:

When there is no support for GDS for a specific file system.

The

`nvidia-fs.ko`

driver is not enabled in the system by the administrator.

To enable compatibility mode:

Remove the

`nvidia-fs`

kernel driver:$ rmmod nvidia-fs

In the /etc/cufile.json file, set

`compat-mode`

to`true`

.Set the

`CUFILE_FORCE_COMPAT_MODE`

environment variable to true.

The IO through `cuFileRead`

/`cuFileWrite`

will now fall back to the CPU path.

## 6.10. Tracking the IO After Enabling Compatibility Mode[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#tracking-the-io-after-enabling-compatibility-mode)

When GDS is used in compatibility mode, and `cufile_stats`

is enabled in the `/etc/cufile.json`

file, you can
use `gds_stats`

or another standard Linux tools, such as strace, iostat, iotop, SAR, ftrace, and perf. You can
also use the BPF compiler collection tools to track and monitor the IO.

When compatibility mode is enabled, internally, `cuFileRead`

and `cuFileWrite`

use POSIX pread and pwrite
system calls, respectively.

## 6.11. Bypassing GPUDirect Storage[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#bypassing-gpudirect-storage)

There are some scenarios in which you can bypass GDS.

There are some tunables where GDS IO and POSIX IO can go through simultaneously. The following are cases where GDS can be bypassed without having to remove the GDS driver:

On supported file systems and block devices.

In the

`/etc/cufile.json`

file, if the`posix_unaligned_writes`

config property is set to`true`

, the unaligned writes will fall back to the compatibility mode and will not go through GDS. Refer to[Before You Install GDS](https://docs.nvidia.com#install-prereqs)for a list of supported file systems.On EXAScaler and Amazon FSx for Lustre file system:

In the /etc/cufile.json file, if the

`posix_gds_min_kb config`

property is set to a certain value (in KB), the IO for which the size is less than or equal to the set value, will fall back to POSIX mode. For example, if`posix_gds_min_kb`

is set to 8KB, IOs with a size that is less than or equal to 8KB, will fall back to the POSIX mode.On a WekaIO file system:

In the

`/etc/cufile.json`

file, if the`allow-compat-mode config`

property is set to`true`

,`cuFileRead`

automatically falls back to the POSIX mode if:RDMA connections and/or memory registrations cannot be established.

`cuFileRead`

fails to allocate an internal bounce buffer for non-4K aligned GPU VA addresses.


Refer to the [GPUDirect Storage Best Practices Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/gpudirect-storage/best-practices-guide/index.html)
for more information.

## 6.12. GDS Does Not Work for a Mount[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gds-does-not-work-for-a-mount)

GDS will not be used for a mount in the following cases:

When the necessary GDS drivers are not loaded on the system.

The file system associated with that mount is not supported by GDS.

The mount point is denylisted in the /etc/cufile.json file.


## 6.13. Simultaneously Running the GPUDirect Storage IO and POSIX IO on the Same File[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#simultaneously-running-the-gpudirect-storage-io-and-posix-io-on-the-same-file)

Since a file is opened in `O_DIRECT`

mode for GDS, applications should avoid mixing `O_DIRECT`

and normal
I/O to the same file and to overlapping byte regions in the same file.

Even when the file system correctly handles the coherency issues in this situation, overall I/O throughput
might be slower than using either mode alone. Similarly, applications should avoid mixing `mmap(2)`

of files
with direct I/O to the same files. Refer to the file system-specific documentation for information about
additional `O_DIRECT`

limitations.

## 6.14. Running Data Verification Tests Using GPUDirect Storage[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#running-data-verification-tests-using-gpudirect-storage)

GDS has an internal data verification utility, `gdsio_verify`

, which is used to test data integrity of
reads and writes. Run `gdsio_verify -h`

for detailed usage information.

For example:

```
$ /usr/local/cuda-11.2/gds/tools/gds_verify -f /mnt/ai200/fio-seq-writes-1 -d 0 -o 0 -s 1G -n 1 -m 1
```

Sample output:

```
gpu index :0,file :/mnt/ai200/fio-seq-writes-1, RING buffer size :0,
gpu buffer alignment :0, gpu buffer offset :0, file offset :0,
io_requested :1073741824, bufregister :true, sync :1, nr ios :1,
fsync :0,
address = 0x560d32c17000
Data Verification Success
```

Note

This test completes data verification of reads and writes through GDS.

# 7. Troubleshooting Performance[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#troubleshooting-performance)

This section covers issues related to performance.

## 7.1. Running Performance Benchmarks with GDS[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#running-performance-benchmarks-with-gds)

You can run performance benchmarks with GDS and compare the results with CPU numbers.

GDS has a homegrown benchmarking utility, `/usr/local/cuda-x.y/gds/tools/gdsio`

, which helps you compare
GDS IO throughput numbers with CPU IO throughput. Run `gdsio -h`

for detailed usage information.

Here are some examples:

**GDS: Storage –> GPU Memory**

```
$ /usr/local/cuda-x.y/tools/gdsio -f /mnt/ai200/fio-seq-writes-1 -d 0 -w 4 -s 10G -i 1M -I 0 -x 0
```

**Storage –> CPU Memory**

```
$ /usr/local/cuda-x.y/tools/gdsio -f /mnt/ai200/fio-seq-writes-1 -d 0 -w 4 -s 10G -i 1M -I 0 -x 1
```

**Storage –> CPU Memory –> GPU Memory**

```
$ /usr/local/cuda-x.y/tool/gdsio -f /mnt/ai200/fio-seq-writes-1 -d 0 -w 4 -s 10G -i 1M -I 0 -x 2
```

**Storage –> GPU Memory using batch mode**

```
$ /usr/local/cuda-x.y/tool/gdsio -f /mnt/ai200/fio-seq-read-1 -d 0 -w 4 -s 10G -i 1M -I 0 -x 6
```

**Storage –> GPU Memory using async stream mode**

```
$ /usr/local/cuda-x.y/tool/gdsio -f /mnt/ai200/fio-seq-read-1 -d 0 -w 4 -s 10G -i 1M -I 0 -x 5
```

## 7.2. Tracking Whether GPUDirect Storage is Using an Internal Cache[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#tracking-whether-gpudirect-storage-is-using-an-internal-cache)

You can determine whether GDS is using an internal cache.

**Prerequisite**: Before you start, read the [GPUDirect Storage Best Practices Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/gpudirect-storage/best-practices-guide/index.html).

GDS Stats has per-GPU stats, and each piece of the GPU bus device function (BDF) information is displayed.
If the `cache_MB`

field is active on a GPU, GDS is using the cache internally to complete the IO.

GDS might use the internal cache when one of the following conditions are true:

The

`file_offset`

that was issued in`cuFileRead`

/`cuFileWrite`

is not 4K aligned.The size in

`cuFileRead`

/`cuFileWrite`

calls are not 4K aligned.The

`devPtr_base`

that was issued in`cuFileRead`

/`cuFileWrite`

is not 4K aligned.The

`devPtr_base+devPtr_offset`

that was issued in`cuFileRead`

/`cuFileWrite`

is not 4K aligned.

## 7.3. Tracking when IO Crosses the PCIe Root Complex and Impacts Performance[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#tracking-when-io-crosses-the-pcie-root-complex-and-impacts-performance)

You can track when the IO crosses the PCIe root complex and affects performance.

Refer to [Checking Peer Affinity Stats for a Kernel File System and Storage Drivers](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-peer-affinity-stats) for more information.

## 7.4. Using GPUDirect Statistics to Monitor CPU Activity[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-gpudirect-statistics-to-monitor-cpu-activity)

Although you cannot use GDS statistics to monitor CPU activity, you can use the following Linux tools to complete this task:

`htop`

`perf`

`mpstat`


## 7.5. Monitoring Performance and Tracing with cuFile-* APIs[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#monitoring-performance-and-tracing-with-cufile-apis)

You can monitor performance and tracing with the cuFile-* APIs.

You can use the FTrace, the Perf, or the BCC-BPF tools to monitor performance and tracing. Ensure that you have the symbols that you can use to track and monitor the performance with a standard Linux IO tool.

## 7.6. Example: Using Linux Tracing Tools[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-using-linux-tracing-tools)

The `cuFileBufRegister`

function makes the pages that underlie a range of GPU virtual memory accessible to a
third-party device. This process is completed by pinning the GPU device memory in the BAR space, which is an
expensive operation and can take up to a few milliseconds.

You can using the BCC/BPF tool to trace the `cuFileBufRegister`

API, understand what is happening in the
Linux kernel, and understand why this process is expensive.

**Scenario**

You are running a workload with 8 threads where each thread is issuing

`cuFileBufRegister`

to pin to the GPU memory.$ ./gdsio -f /mnt/ai200/seq-writes-1 -d 0 -w 8 -s 10G -i 1M -I 0 -x 0

When IO is in progress, use a tracing tool to understand what is going on with

`cuFileBufRegister`

:$ /usr/share/bcc/tools# ./funccount -Ti 1 nvfs_mgroup_pin_shadow_pages

Review the sample output:

15:04:56 FUNC COUNT nvfs_mgroup_pin_shadow_pages 8

As you can see, the

`nvfs_mgroup_pin_shadow_pages`

function has been invoked 8 times in one per thread.To see the latency for that function, run:

$ /usr/share/bcc/tools# ./funclatency -i 1 nvfs_mgroup_pin_shadow_pages

Review the output:

Tracing 1 functions for "nvfs_mgroup_pin_shadow_pages"... Hit Ctrl-C to end. nsecs : count distribution 0 -> 1 : 0 | | 2 -> 3 : 0 | | 4 -> 7 : 0 | | 8 -> 15 : 0 | | 16 -> 31 : 0 | | 32 -> 63 : 0 | | 64 -> 127 : 0 | | 128 -> 255 : 0 | | 256 -> 511 : 0 | | 512 -> 1023 : 0 | | 1024 -> 2047 : 0 | | 2048 -> 4095 : 0 | | 4096 -> 8191 : 0 | | 8192 -> 16383 : 1 |***** | 16384 -> 32767 : 7 |****************************************|

Seven calls of the

`nvfs_mgroup_pin_shadow_pages`

function took about 16-32 microseconds. This is probably coming from the Linux kernel`get_user_pages_fast`

that is used to pin shadow pages.`cuFileBufRegister`

invokes`nvidia_p2p_get_pages`

NVIDIA driver function to pin GPU device memory in the BAR space. This information is obtained by running`$ perf top -g`

and getting the call graph of`cuFileBufRegister`

.

The following example the overhead of the `nvidia_p2p_get_pages`

:

```
$ /usr/share/bcc/tools# ./funclatency -Ti 1 nvidia_p2p_get_pages
15:45:19

```

## 7.7. Tracing the cuFile* APIs[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#tracing-the-cufile-apis)

You can use nvprof/NVIDIA Nsight to trace the `cuFile`

* APIs.

NVTX static tracepoints are available for the public interfaces in the `libcufile.so`

library, and NVTX tracing is enabled by default. After
these static tracepoints are enabled, you can view these traces in NVIDIA Nsight just like any other CUDA symbols.

## 7.8. Improving Performance using Dynamic Routing[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#improving-performance-using-dynamic-routing)

On platforms where the IO transfers between GPU(s) and the storage NICs involve PCIe traffic across PCIe-host bridge,
GPUDirect Storage IO may not see a great throughput especially for writes. Also, certain chipsets may support only
P2P read traffic for host bridge traffic. In such cases, the dynamic routing feature can be enabled to debug and
identify what routing policy is deemed best for such platforms. This can be illustrated with a single GPU write
test with the `gdsio`

tool, where there is one Storage NIC and 10 GPUs with NVLINKs access enabled between the
GPUS. With dynamic routing enabled, even though the GPU and NIC might be on different sockets, GDS can still
achieve the maximum possible write throughput.

```
$ cat /etc/cufile.json | grep rdma_dev
"rdma_dev_addr_list": [ "192.168.0.19" ],
```

Dynamic Routing OFF:

```
$ cat /etc/cufile.json | grep routing
"rdma_dynamic_routing": false
$ for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10;
do
./gdsio -f /mnt/nfs/file1 -d $i -n 0 -w 4 -s 1G -i 1M -x 0 -I 1 -p -T 15 ;
done
```

# 8. Troubleshooting IO Activity[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#troubleshooting-io-activity)

This section covers issues that are related to IO activity and the interactions with the rest of Linux.

## 8.1. Managing Coherency of Data in the Page Cache and on Disk[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#managing-coherency-of-data-in-the-page-cache-and-on-disk)

When using GDS, files are often opened with the `O_DIRECT`

mode. When IO is complete, in the context of DIRECT IO, it bypasses the page cache.

Starting with CUDA toolkit 12.2 (GDS version 1.7.x) files can also be opened with non-O_DIRECT mode. Even in such a case, whenever the library software deems fit, it will follow the GDS enabled O_DIRECT path. This conserves coherency by default.

On EXAScaler file system:

For reads, IO bypasses the page cache and fetches the data directly from backend storage.

When writes are issued, the

`nvidia-fs`

drivers will try to flush the data in the page cache for the range of offset-length before issuing writes to the VFS subsystem.The stats that track this information are:

`pg_cache`

`pg_cache_fail`

`pg_cache_eio`



On WekaIO file system:

For reads, IO bypasses the page cache and fetches the data directly from backend storage.



# 9. EXAScaler File System LNet Troubleshooting[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#exascaler-file-system-lnet-troubleshooting)

This section describes how to troubleshoot issues with the EXAScaler file system.

## 9.1. Determining the EXAScaler File system Client Module Version[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#determining-the-exascaler-file-system-client-module-version)

To check the EXAScaler file system Client version, check dmesg after you install the EXAScaler file system.

Note

The EXAScaler server version should be EXA-5.2.

This table provides a list of the client kernel module versions that have been tested with DDN AI200 and DDN AI400 systems:

DDN Client Version |
Kernel Version |
MLNX_OFED version |
|---|---|---|
2.12.3_ddn28 |
4.15.0 |
MLNX_OFED 4.7 |
2.12.3_ddn29 |
4.15.0 |
MLNX_OFED 4.7 |
2.12.3_ddn39 |
4.15.0 |
MLNX_OFED 5.1 |
2.12.5_ddn4 |
5.4.0 |
MLNX_OFED 5.1 |
2.12.6_ddn19 |
5.4.0 |
MLNX_OFED 5.3 |

To verify the client version, run the following command:

```
$ sudo lctl get_param version
```

Sample output:

```
Lustre version: 2.12.3_ddn39
```

## 9.2. Checking the LNet Network Setup on a Client[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-the-lnet-network-setup-on-a-client)

To check the LNet network setup on the client:

Run the following command.

$ sudo lnetctl net show:

Review the output, for example:

net: - net type: lo


## 9.3. Checking the Health of the Peers[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-the-health-of-the-peers)

An Lnet health value of 1000 is the best possible value that can be reported for a network interface. Anything less than 1000 indicates that the interface is running in a degraded mode and has encountered some errors.

Run the following command;

$ sudo lnetctl net show -v 3 | grep health

Review the output, for example:

health stats: health stats: health value: 1000 health stats: health value: 1000 health stats: health value: 1000 health stats: health value: 1000 health stats: health value: 1000 health stats: health value: 1000 health stats: health value: 1000 health stats: health value: 1000


## 9.4. Checking for Multi-Rail Support[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-for-multi-rail-support)

To verify whether multi-rail is supported:

Run the following command:

$ sudo lnetctl peer show | grep -i Multi-Rail:

Review the output, for example:

Multi-Rail: True


## 9.5. Checking GDS Peer Affinity[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-gds-peer-affinity)

For peer affinity, you need to check whether the expected interfaces are being used for the associated GPUs.

The code snippet below is a description of a test that runs load on a specific GPU. The test validates whether the
interface that is performing the send and receive is the interface that is the closest, and is correctly mapped,
to the GPU. See [Resetting the nvidia-fs Statistics](https://docs.nvidia.com#reset-nvidia-fs-stats) and [Checking Peer Affinity Stats for a Kernel File System and Storage Drivers](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-peer-affinity-stats) for more information about the metrics
that are used to check peer affinity.

You can run a `gdsio`

test for the tools section and monitor the LNET stats. See the readme file for more information.
In the `gdsio`

test, a write test has been completed on GPU 0. The expected NIC interface for GPU 0 is ib0 on the
NVIDIA DGX-2 platform. The `lnetctl net`

show statistics were previously captured, and after the `gdsio`

test, you can see that the RPC send and receive have happened over the IB0.

Run the

`gdsio`

test.Review the output, for example:

$ sudo lustre_rmmod $ sudo mount -t lustre 192.168.1.61@o2ib,192.168.1.62@o2ib:/ai200 /mnt/ai200/ $ sudo lnetctl net show -v 3 | grep health health stats: health value: 0 health stats: health value: 1000 health stats: health value: 1000 health stats: health value: 1000 health stats: health value: 1000 health stats: health value: 1000 health stats: health value: 1000 health stats: health value: 1000 $ sudo lnetctl net show -v 3 | grep -B 2 -i 'send_count\|recv_count' status: up statistics: send_count: 0 recv_count: 0 -- 0: ib0 statistics: send_count: 3 recv_count: 3 -- 0: ib2 statistics: send_count: 3 recv_count: 3 -- 0: ib3 statistics: send_count: 2 recv_count: 2 -- 0: ib4 statistics: send_count: 13 recv_count: 13 -- 0: ib5 statistics: send_count: 12 recv_count: 12 -- 0: ib6 statistics: send_count: 12 recv_count: 12 -- 0: ib7 statistics: send_count: 11 recv_count: 11 $ echo 1 > /sys/module/nvidia_fs/parameters/peer_stats_enabled $ /usr/local/cuda-x.y/tools/gdsio -f /mnt/ai200/test -d 0 -n 0 -w 1 -s 1G -i 4K -x 0 -I 1 IoType: WRITE XferType: GPUD Threads: 1 DataSetSize: 1073741824/1073741824 IOSize: 4(KB),Throughput: 0.004727 GB/sec, Avg_Latency: 807.026154 usecs ops: 262144 total_time 211562847.000000 usecs $ sudo lnetctl net show -v 3 | grep -B 2 -i 'send_count\|recv_count' status: up statistics: send_count: 0 recv_count: 0 -- 0: ib0 statistics: send_count: 262149 recv_count: 524293 -- 0: ib2 statistics: send_count: 6 recv_count: 6 -- 0: ib3 statistics: send_count: 6 recv_count: 6 -- 0: ib4 statistics: send_count: 33 recv_count: 33 -- 0: ib5 statistics: send_count: 32 recv_count: 32 -- 0: ib6 statistics: send_count: 32 recv_count: 32 -- 0: ib7 statistics: send_count: 32 recv_count: 32 $ cat /proc/driver/nvidia-fs/peer_affinity GPU P2P DMA distribution based on pci-distance (last column indicates p2p via root complex) GPU :0000:be:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:3b:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:e7:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:e5:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:e0:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:57:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:39:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:36:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:e2:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:59:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:b7:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:b9:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:bc:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:34:00.0 :0 0 23872512 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:5e:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 GPU :0000:5c:00.0 :0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0


## 9.6. Checking for LNet-Level Errors[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-for-lnet-level-errors)

The errors impact the health of individual NICs and affect how the EXAScaler file system selects the best peer, which impacts GDS performance.

Note

To run these commands, you must have sudo priveleges.

Run the following command:

If you see incrementing error stats, capture the net logging and provide this information for debugging:

```
$ lctl set_param debug=+net

$ lctl dk > logfile.dk
```

## 9.7. Resolving LNet NIDs Health Degradation from Timeouts[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#resolving-lnet-nids-health-degradation-from-timeouts)

With large machines, such as DGX that have multiple interfaces, if Linux routing is not correctly set up, there might be connection failures and other unexpected behavior.

A typical network setting that is used to resolve local connection timeouts is:

```
sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_local=1
```

There are also generic pointers for resolving LNet Network issues. Refer to
[MR Cluster Setup](https://wiki.whamcloud.com/display/LNet/MR+Cluster+Setup) for more information.

## 9.8. Configuring LNet Networks with Multiple OSTs for Optimal Peer Selection[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#configuring-lnet-networks-with-multiple-osts-for-optimal-peer-selection)

When there are multiple OSTs (Object Storage Targets), and each OST is dual interface, to need to have one interface on each of the LNets for which the client is configured.

For example, you have the following two LNet Subnets on the client side:

`o2ib`

`o2ib1`


The server has only one Lnet subnet, `o2ib`

. In this situation, the routing is not optimal, because you
are restricting the ib selection logic to a set of devices, which may not be closest to the GPU. There is
no way to reach OST2 except over the LNet to which it is connected.

The traffic that goes to this OST will never be optimal, and this configuration might affect overall
throughput and latency. If, however, you configure the server to use two networks, `o2ib0`

and `o2ib1`

,
then OST1 and OST2 can be reached over both networks. When the selection algorithm runs, it will determine
that the best path is, for example, OST2 over `o2ib1`

.

To configure the client-side LNET, run the following command:

$ sudo lnetctl net show

Review the output, for example:

net: - net type: lo local NI(s): - nid: 0@lo status: up - net type: o2ib local NI(s): - nid: 192.168.1.71@o2ib status: up interfaces: 0: ib0 - nid: 192.168.1.72@o2ib status: up interfaces: 0: ib2 - nid: 192.168.1.73@o2ib status: up interfaces: 0: ib4 - nid: 192.168.1.74@o2ib status: up interfaces: 0: ib6 - net type: o2ib1 local NI(s): - nid: 192.168.2.71@o2ib1 status: up interfaces: 0: ib1 - nid: 192.168.2.72@o2ib1 status: up interfaces: 0: ib3 - nid: 192.168.2.73@o2ib1 status: up interfaces: 0: ib5 - nid: 192.168.2.74@o2ib1 status: up interfaces: 0: ib7


For an optimal configuration, the LNet peer should show two LNet subnets.

In this case, the primary `nid`

is only one `o2ib`

:

```
$ sudo lnetctl peer show
```

Sample output:

```
peer:
- primary nid: 192.168.1.62@o2ib
Multi-Rail: True
peer ni:
- nid: 192.168.1.62@o2ib
state: NA
- nid: 192.168.2.62@o2ib1
state: NA
- primary nid: 192.168.1.61@o2ib
Multi-Rail: True
peer ni:
- nid: 192.168.1.61@o2ib
state: NA
- nid: 192.168.2.61@o2ib1
state: NA
```

From the server side, here is an example of sub-optimal LNet configuration:

```
[root@ai200-090a-vm01 ~]# lnetctl net show
net:
- net type: lo
local NI(s):
- nid: 0@lo
status: up
- net type: o2ib (o2ib1 is not present)
local NI(s):
- nid: 192.168.1.62@o2ib
status: up
interfaces:
0: ib0
- nid: 192.168.2.62@o2ib
status: up
interfaces:
0: ib1
```

Here is an example of an IB configuration for a non-optimal case, where a file is stripped over two OSTs, and there are sequential reads:

```

# 10. Understanding EXAScaler File System Performance[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#understanding-exascaler-file-system-performance)

Depending on the type of host channel adapter (HCA), commonly known as a NIC, there are mod parameters that can be tuned for LNet. The NICs that you select should be up and healthy.

To verify the health by mounting and running some basic tests, use `lnetctl`

health statistics, and
run the following command:

```
$ cat /etc/modprobe.d/lustre.conf
```

Example output:

```
options libcfs cpu_npartitions=24 cpu_pattern=""
options lnet networks="o2ib0(ib1,ib2,ib3,ib4,ib6,ib7,ib8,ib9)"
options ko2iblnd peer_credits=32 concurrent_sends=64 peer_credits_hiw=16 map_on_demand=0
```

## 10.1. osc Tuning Performance Parameters[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#osc-tuning-performance-parameters)

The following is information about tuning file system parameters.

Note

To maximize the throughput, you can tune the following EXAScaler file system client parameters, based on the network.

Run the following command:


```
$ lctl get_param osc.*.max* osc.*.checksums
```

Review the output, for example:


```
$ lctl get_param osc.*.max* osc.*.checksums
osc.ai400-OST0024-osc-ffff916f6533a000.max_pages_per_rpc=4096
osc.ai400-OST0024-osc-ffff916f6533a000.max_dirty_mb=512
osc.ai400-OST0024-osc-ffff916f6533a000.max_rpcs_in_flight=32
osc.ai400-OST0024-osc-ffff916f6533a000.checksums=0
```

To check llite parameters, run `$ lctl get_param llite.*.*`

.

## 10.2. Miscellaneous Commands for osc, mdc, and stripesize[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#miscellaneous-commands-for-osc-mdc-and-stripesize)

If the tuning parameters are set correctly, you can use these parameters to observe.

To get an overall EXAScaler file system client side statistics, run the following command:

$ lctl get_param osc.*.import

Note

The command includes

`rpc`

information.Review the output, for example:

$ watch -d 'lctl get_param osc.*.import | grep -B 1 inflight' rpcs: inflight: 5 rpcs: inflight: 33

To get the maximum number of pages that can be transferred per rpc in a EXAScaler file system client, run the following command:

$ lctl get_param osc.*.max_pages_per_rpc

To get the overall rpc statistics from a EXAScaler file system client, run the following command:

$ lctl set_param osc.*.rpc_stats=clear (to reset osc stats) $ lctl get_param osc.*.rpc_stats

Review the output, for example:

osc.ai200-OST0000-osc-ffff8e0b47c73800.rpc_stats= snapshot_time: 1589919461.185215594 (secs.nsecs) read RPCs in flight: 0 write RPCs in flight: 0 pending write pages: 0 pending read pages: 0 read write pages per rpc rpcs % cum % | rpcs % cum % 1: 14222350 77 77 | 0 0 0 2: 0 0 77 | 0 0 0 4: 0 0 77 | 0 0 0 8: 0 0 77 | 0 0 0 16: 0 0 77 | 0 0 0 32: 0 0 77 | 0 0 0 64: 0 0 77 | 0 0 0 128: 0 0 77 | 0 0 0 256: 4130365 22 100 | 0 0 0 read write rpcs in flight rpcs % cum % | rpcs % cum % 0: 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 1: 3236263 17 17 | 0 0 0 2: 117001 0 18 | 0 0 0 3: 168119 0 19 | 0 0 0 4: 153295 0 20 | 0 0 0 5: 91598 0 20 | 0 0 0 6: 42476 0 20 | 0 0 0 7: 17578 0 20 | 0 0 0 8: 9454 0 20 | 0 0 0 9: 7611 0 20 | 0 0 0 10: 7772 0 20 | 0 0 0 11: 8914 0 21 | 0 0 0 12: 9350 0 21 | 0 0 0 13: 8559 0 21 | 0 0 0 14: 8734 0 21 | 0 0 0 15: 10784 0 21 | 0 0 0 16: 11386 0 21 | 0 0 0 17: 13148 0 21 | 0 0 0 18: 15473 0 21 | 0 0 0 19: 17619 0 21 | 0 0 0 20: 18851 0 21 | 0 0 0 21: 21853 0 21 | 0 0 0 22: 21236 0 21 | 0 0 0 23: 21588 0 22 | 0 0 0 24: 23859 0 22 | 0 0 0 25: 24049 0 22 | 0 0 0 26: 26232 0 22 | 0 0 0 27: 29853 0 22 | 0 0 0 28: 31992 0 22 | 0 0 0 29: 43626 0 22 | 0 0 0 30: 116116 0 23 | 0 0 0 31: 14018326 76 100 | 0 0 0


To get statistics that are related to client metadata operations, run the following command:

Note

MetaDataClient (MDC) is the client side counterpart of MetaData Server (MDS).

```
$ lctl get_param mdc.*.md_stats
```

To get the stripe layout of the file on the EXAScaler file system, run the following command:

```
$ lfs getstripe /mnt/ai200
```

## 10.3. Getting the Number of Configured Object-Based Disks[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#getting-the-number-of-configured-object-based-disks)

To get the number of configured object-bsaed disks:

Run the following command:

$ lctl get_param lov.*.target_obd

Review the output, for example:

0: ai200-OST0000_UUID ACTIVE 1: ai200-OST0001_UUID ACTIVE


## 10.5. Getting Metadata Statistics[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#getting-metadata-statistics)

To get metadata statistics:

Run the following command:

$ lctl get_param lmv.*.md_stats

Review the output, for example:

snapshot_time 1571271931.653827773 secs.nsecs close 8 samples [reqs] create 1 samples [reqs] getattr 1 samples [reqs] intent_lock 81 samples[reqs] read_page 3 samples [reqs] revalidate_lock 1 samples [reqs]


## 10.6. Checking for an Existing Mount[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-for-an-existing-mount)

To check for an existing mount in the EXAScaler file system:

Run the following command:

$ mount | grep lustre

Review the output, for example:

192.168.1.61@o2ib,192.168.1.62@o2ib1:/ai200 on /mnt/ai200 type lustre (rw,flock,lazystatfs)


## 10.7. Unmounting an EXAScaler File System Cluster[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#unmounting-an-exascaler-file-system-cluster)

To unmount an EXAScaler file system cluster, run the following command:

$ sudo umount /mnt/ai200

## 10.8. Getting a Summary of EXAScaler File System Statistics[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#getting-a-summary-of-exascaler-file-system-statistics)

You can get a summary of statistics for the EXAScaler file system.

Refer to the [Lustre Monitoring and Statistics Guide](http://wiki.lustre.org/Lustre_Monitoring_and_Statistics_Guide) for more information.

## 10.9. Using GPUDirect Storage in Poll Mode[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-gpudirect-storage-in-poll-mode)

This section describes how to use GDS in Poll Mode with EXAScaler file system files that have a Stripe Count greater than 1.

Currently, if poll mode is enabled, `cuFileReads`

or `cuFileWrites`

might return bytes that are less than the
bytes that were requested. This behavior is POSIX compliant and is observed with files that have a stripe count
that is greater than the count in their layout. If behavior occurs, we recommend that the application checks for
returned bytes and continues until all of the data is consumed. You can also set the corresponding
`properties.poll_mode_max_size_kb,(say 1024(KB))`

value to the lowest possible stripe size in the directory.
This ensures that IO sizes that exceed this limit are not polled.

To check EXAScaler file system file layout, run the following command.

To troubleshoot issues with the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, visit the
[FSx for Lustre documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/what-is.html).

# 12. WekaFS Troubleshooting[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#wekafs-troubleshooting)

This section provides troubleshooting and FAQ information about the WekaIO file system.

## 12.1. Downloading the WekaIO Client Package[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#downloading-the-wekaio-client-package)

To download the WekaIO client package, run the following command:

```
$ curl http://<IP of one of the WekaIO hosts' IB interface>:14000/dist/v1/install | sh
```

For example, `$ curl http://172.16.8.1:14000/dist/v1/install | sh`

.

## 12.2. Determining Whether the WekaIO Version is Ready for GDS[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#determining-whether-the-wekaio-version-is-ready-for-gds)

To determine whether the WekaIO version is ready for GDS:

Run the following command:

$ weka version

Review the output, for example:

* 3.6.2.5-rdma-beta

Note

Currently, the only WekaIO FS version that supports GDS is

`* 3.6.2.5-rdma-beta`


## 12.3. Mounting a WekaIO File System Cluster[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#mounting-a-wekaio-file-system-cluster)

The WekaIO file system can take a parameter to reserve a fixed number of cores for the user space process.

To mount a

`server_ip 172.16.8.1`

with two dedicated cores, run the following command:$ mkdir -p /mnt/weka $ sudo mount -t wekafs -o num_cores=2 -o net=ib0,net=ib1,net=ib2,net=ib3,net=ib4,net=ib5,net=ib6,net=ib7 172.16.8.1/fs01 /mnt/weka

Review the output, for example:

Mounting 172.16.8.1/fs01 on /mnt/weka Creating weka container Starting container Waiting for container to join cluster Container "client" is ready (pid = 47740) Calling the mount command Mount completed successfully


## 12.4. Resolving a Failing Mount[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#resolving-a-failing-mount)

Before you use the IB interfaces in the mount options, verify that the interfaces are set up for

`net=<interface>`

:$ sudo mount -t wekafs -o num_cores=2 -o net=ib0,net=ib1,net=ib2,net=ib3,net=ib4,net=ib5,net=ib6,net=ib7 172.16.8.1/fs01 /mnt/weka

Review the output, for example:

Mounting 172.16.8.1/fs01 on /mnt/weka Creating weka container Starting container Waiting for container to join cluster error: Container "client" has run into an error: Resources assignment failed: IB/MLNX network devices should have pre-configured IPs and ib4 has none

Remove interfaces that do not have network connectivity from the mount options.

$ ibdev2netdev mlx5_0 port 1 ==> ib0 (Up) mlx5_1 port 1 ==> ib1 (Up) mlx5_2 port 1 ==> ib2 (Up) mlx5_3 port 1 ==> ib3 (Up) mlx5_4 port 1 ==> ib4 (Down) mlx5_5 port 1 ==> ib5 (Down) mlx5_6 port 1 ==> ib6 (Up) mlx5_7 port 1 ==> ib7 (Up) mlx5_8 port 1 ==> ib8 (Up) mlx5_9 port 1 ==> ib9 (Up)


## 12.5. Resolving 100% Usage for WekaIO for Two Cores[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#resolving-100-usage-for-wekaio-for-two-cores)

If you have two cores, and you are experiencing 100% CPU usage:

Run the following command.

$ top

Review the output, for example:

PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND 54816 root 20 0 11.639g 1.452g 392440 R 94.4 0.1 781:06.06 wekanode 54825 root 20 0 11.639g 1.452g 392440 R 94.4 0.1 782:00.32 wekanode

When the

`num_cores=2`

parameter is specified, two cores are used for the user mode poll driver for WekaIO FE networking. This process improves the latency and performance. Refer to the[WekaIO documentation](https://docs.weka.io/)for more information.

## 12.6. Checking for an Existing Mount in the Weka File System[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-for-an-existing-mount-in-the-weka-file-system)

To check for an existing mount in the WekaIO file system:

Run the following command:

$ mount | grep wekafs

Review the output, for example:

172.16.8.1/fs01 on /mnt/weka type wekafs ( rw,relatime,writecache,inode_bits=auto,dentry_max_age_positive=1000, dentry_max_age_negative=0)


## 12.7. Checking for a Summary of the WekaIO File System Status[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-for-a-summary-of-the-wekaio-file-system-status)

To check for a summary of the WekaIO file system status.

Run the following command:

$ weka status

Review the output, for example:

WekaIO v3.6.2.5-rdma-beta (CLI build 3.6.2.5-rdma-beta) cluster: Nvidia (e4a4e227-41d0-47e5-aa70-b50688b31f40) status: OK (12 backends UP, 72 drives UP) protection: 8+2 hot spare: 2 failure domains (62.84 TiB) drive storage: 62.84 TiB total, 819.19 MiB unprovisioned cloud: connected license: Unlicensed io status: STARTED 1 day ago (1584 buckets UP, 228 io-nodes UP) link layer: InfiniBand clients: 1 connected reads: 61.54 GiB/s (63019 IO/s) writes: 0 B/s (0 IO/s) operations: 63019 ops/s alerts: 3 active alerts, use `Wekaalerts` to list them


## 12.8. Displaying the Summary of the WekaIO File System Statistics[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#displaying-the-summary-of-the-wekaio-file-system-statistics)

To display a summary of the status of the WekaIO file system:

Run the following command.

$ cat /proc/wekafs/stat

Review the output, for example:

## 12.9. Why WekaIO Writes Go Through POSIX[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#why-wekaio-writes-go-through-posix)

For the WekaIO file system, GDS supports RDMA based reads and writes. You can use the `fs:weka:rdma_write_support`

JSON
property to enable writes on supported Weka file systems. This option is disabled by default. If this option is set to false,
writes will be internally staged through system memory, and the cuFile library will use pwrite POSIX calls internally for writes.

## 12.10. Checking for nvidia-fs.ko Support for Memory Peer Direct[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-for-nvidia-fs-ko-support-for-memory-peer-direct)

To check for `nvidia-fs.ko`

support for memory peer direct:

Run the following command:

$ lsmod | grep nvidia_fs | grep ib_core && echo "Ready for Memory Peer Direct"

Review the output, for example:

ib_core 319488 16 rdma_cm,ib_ipoib,mlx4_ib,ib_srp,iw_cm,nvidia_fs,ib_iser,ib_umad, rdma_ucm,ib_uverbs,mlx5_ib,ib_cm,ib_ucm "Ready for Memory Peer Direct"


## 12.11. Checking Memory Peer Direct Stats[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-memory-peer-direct-stats)

To to check memory peer statistics:

Run the following script, which shows the counter for memroy peer direct statistics:

list=`ls /sys/kernel/mm/memory_peers/nvidia-fs/`. for stat in $list . do echo "$stat value: " $(cat /sys/kernel/mm/memory_peers/nvidia-fs/$stat). done

Review the output.

num_alloc_mrs value: 1288 num_dealloc_mrs value: 1288 num_dereg_bytes value: 1350565888 num_dereg_pages value: 329728 num_free_callbacks value: 0 num_reg_bytes value: 1350565888 num_reg_pages value: 329728 version value: 1.0


## 12.12. Checking for Relevant nvidia-fs Statistics for the WekaIO File System[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-for-relevant-nvidia-fs-statistics-for-the-wekaio-file-system)

To check for relevant `nvida-fs`

statistics for the WekaIO file system:

Run the following command:

$ cat /proc/driver/nvidia-fs/stats | egrep -v 'Reads|Writes|Ops|Error'

## 12.16. GDS Configuration File Changes to Support the WekaIO File System[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gds-configuration-file-changes-to-support-the-wekaio-file-system)

By default, the configuration for Weka RDMA-based writes is disabled.

```
"fs": {
"weka": {
// enable/disable WekaFs rdma write
"rdma_write_support" : false
}
}
```

To support the WekaIO file system, change the configuration to add a new property, `rdma_dev_addr_list`

:

```
"properties": {
// allow compat mode,
// this will enable use of cufile posix read/writes
//"allow_compat_mode": true,
"rdma_dev_addr_list": [
"172.16.8.88" , "172.16.8.89",
"172.16.8.90" , "172.16.8.91",
"172.16.8.92" , "172.16.8.93",
"172.16.8.94", "172.16.8.95"
]
}
```

Note

For CUDA 11.5.1 and later, if you plan to use Weka FS then you must run:

```
modprobe nvidia_peermem
```

This will load the module that supports PeerDirect capabilities. It is necessary to run this command after reboot of the system.

In order to load the module automatically after every reboot, run the following command:

```
echo "nvidia-peermem" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/nvidia-peermem.conf
```

## 12.17. Check for Relevant User-Space Statistics for the WekaIO File System[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#check-for-relevant-user-space-statistics-for-the-wekaio-file-system)

To check for relevant user-space statistics for the WekaIO file system, issue the following command:

## 13.6. GDS User Space Stats for IBM Spectrum Scale for Each Process[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gds-user-space-stats-for-ibm-spectrum-scale-for-each-process)

To check GDS user space level stats, make sure the `cufile_stats`

property in `cufile.json`

is set to 3. Run the
following command to check the user space stats for a specific process:

```
$ /usr/local/cuda-<x>.<y>/gds/tools/gds_stats -p <pid> -l 3

In the example above, 3954 MiB of IBM Spectrum Scale Read-IO went through `mlx5_0`

and 3708 MiB MiB of IBM Spectrum
Scale Read went through `mlx5_1`

. The `RDMA MRSTATS`

value shows the number of RDMA memory registrations and
size of those registrations.

## 13.7. GDS Configuration to Support IBM Spectrum Scale[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gds-configuration-to-support-ibm-spectrum-scale)

Configure the DC key.

The DC key for the IBM Spectrum Scale client can be configured in the following ways:

Set the environment variable

`CUFILE_RDMA_DC_KEY`

. This should be set to a 32-bit hex value. This can be set as shown in the following example:export CUFILE_RDMA_DC_KEY = 0x11223344

Set the property

`rdma_dc_key`

in`cufile.json`

. This property is a 32-bit value and can be set as shown in the following example:"rdma_dc_key": "0xffeeddcc",


In case both the environment variable and the

`cufile.json`

have the property set, the environment variable`CUFILE_RDMA_DC_KEY`

will take precedence over the`rdma_dc_key`

property set in`cufile.json`

.In case none of the above is set, the default DC Key configured is

`0xffeeddcc`

.Configure the IP addresses in

`cufile.json`

.The

`>rdma_dev_addr_list`

property should be set in`cufile.json`

with the IP address of the RDMA devices to be used for IO."properties": { ------- "rdma_dev_addr_list": [ "172.16.8.88" , "172.16.8.89", "172.16.8.90" , "172.16.8.91", "172.16.8.92" , "172.16.8.93", "172.16.8.94", "172.16.8.95" ] } --------- }

Configure the

`max_direct_io_size_kb`

property in`cufile.json`

.You can change the IO size with the following property:

"properties": { ------- "max_direct_io_size_kb" : 1024 --------- }

Configure the

`rdma_access_mask`

property in`cufile.json`

.This property is a performance tunable. Refer to IBM Spectrum Scale documentation in

[https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-scale/5.1.2?topic=configuring-gpudirect-storage-spectrum-scale](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-scale/5.1.2?topic=configuring-gpudirect-storage-spectrum-scale)for optimal configuration of this property."properties": { ------- "rdma_access_mask": "0x1f", --------- }


Note

For CUDA 11.5.1 and later, if you plan to use IBM Spectrum Scale then you must run:

```
modprobe nvidia_peermem
```

This will load the module that supports PeerDirect capabilities. It is necessary to run this command after reboot of the system.

In order to load the module automatically after every reboot, run the following command:

```
echo "nvidia-peermem" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/nvidia-peermem.conf
```

## 13.8. Scenarios for Falling Back to Compatibility Mode[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#scenarios-for-falling-back-to-compatibility-mode)

There are couple of scenarios that will cause the IBM Spectrum Scale IOs to go through compatibility mode, irrespective of
the `allow_compat_mode`

property’s value in `cufile.json`

. For a full list of these cases please refer to [http://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6444075](http://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6444075).

## 13.9. GDS Limitations with IBM Spectrum Scale[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gds-limitations-with-ibm-spectrum-scale)

The current maximum of RDMA memory registrations for a GPU buffer is 16. Hence, the maximum size of memory that
can be registered with RDMA per GPU buffer is 16 * `max_direct_to_size_kb`

(set in `cufile.json`

). Any GDS
IO with IBM Spectrum Scale beyond this offset will go through bounce buffers and might have a performance impact.

# 14. NetApp E-series BeeGFS with GDS Solution Deployment[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#netapp-e-series-beegfs-with-gds-solution-deployment)

NetApp supports BeeGFS High Availability.

Refer to the BeeGFS with Netapp E-Series Technical Report on how to deploy the BeeGFS parallel file system:
[Netapp BeeGFS Deployment](https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/17132-tr4755pdf.pdf). For deployments
requiring high availability, refer to [BeeGFS High Availability with NetApp E-Series](https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/19431-tr-4862.pdf).

## 14.1. Netapp BeeGFS/GPUDirect Storage and Package Requirements[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#netapp-beegfs-gpudirect-storage-and-package-requirements)

BeeGFS client and storage with GDS:

CUDA and GDS are only required on the beegfs-client hosts. There are no CUDA or GPUDirect Storage requirements for the BeeGFS server hosts.

## 14.2. BeeGFS Client Configuration for GDS[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#beegfs-client-configuration-for-gds)

After installing beegfs-client, the client build needs to be configured for RDMA and GDS.

Edit

`/etc/beegfs/beegfs-client-autobuild.conf`

. Change line 57 of the file to:buildArgs=-j8 NVFS_H_PATH=/usr/src/mlnx-ofed-kernel-5.4/drivers/nvme/host OFED_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/src/ofa_kernel/default/include

This should all be on the same line.

Rebuild beegfs-client:

sudo /etc/init.d/beegfs-client rebuild

# 15. Setting Up and Troubleshooting VAST Data (NFSoRDMA+MultiPath)[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#setting-up-and-troubleshooting-vast-data-nfsordma-multipath)

This section provides information about how to set up and troubleshoot VAST data (NFSoRDMA+MultiPath).

## 15.1. Installing MLNX_OFED and VAST NFSoRDMA+Multipath Packages[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#installing-mlnx-ofed-and-vast-nfsordma-multipath-packages)

### 15.1.1. Client Software Requirements[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#client-software-requirements)

The following table lists the **minimum** client software requirements for using MLNX_OFED and VAST NFSoRDMA+Multipath packages.

NFS Connection Type |
Linux Kernel |
MLNX_OFED |
|---|---|---|
NFSoRDMA + Multipath |
The following kernel versions are supported:
|
The following MLNX_OFED versions are supported:
|

For the most up to date supportability matrix and client configuration steps and package downloads, refer
to: [https://kb.vastdata.com/docs/gpu-direct-storage-installation-and-operations-guide-2025](https://kb.vastdata.com/docs/gpu-direct-storage-installation-and-operations-guide-2025).

MLNX_OFED must be installed for the VAST NFSoRDMA+Multipath package to function optimally. It is also important to
download the correct VAST software packages to match your kernel+MLNX_OFED version combination. Refer to
[NVMe and NVMe-oF Troubleshooting](https://docs.nvidia.com#nvme-nvmeof-support) support for information about how to install MLNX_OFED with GDS support.

To verify the current version of MLNX_OFED, issue the following command:

$ ofed_info -s MLNX_OFED_LINUX-5.3-0.6.6.01:

To verify the currently installed Linux kernel version, issue the following command:

$ uname -r -v


After you verify that your system has the correct combination of kernel and MLNX_OFED, you can install the VAST Multipath package.

### 15.1.2. Install the VAST Multipath Package[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#install-the-vast-multipath-package)

Although the VAST Multipath with NFSoRDMA package has been submitted upstream for inclusion in a future kernel release,
it is currently only available as a download from: [https://support.vastdata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016813140-NFSoRDMA-with-Multipath](https://support.vastdata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016813140-NFSoRDMA-with-Multipath).

Be sure to download the correct `.deb`

file that is based on your kernel and MLNX_OFED. version.

Install the VAST NFSoRDMA+Multipath package:

$ sudo apt-get install mlnx-nfsrdma-*.deb

Generate a new initramfs image:

$ sudo update-initramfs -u -k `uname -r`

Verify that the package is installed, and the version is the number that you expected:

$ dpkg -l | grep mlnx-nfsrdma ii mlnx-nfsrdma-dkms 5.3-OFED.5.1.0.6.6.0 all DKMS support for NFS RDMA kernel module

Reboot the host and run the following commands to verify that the correct version is loaded:

Note

The versions shown by each command should match.

$ cat /sys/module/sunrpc/srcversion 4CC8389C7889F82F5A59269 $ modinfo sunrpc | grep srcversion srcversion: 4CC8389C7889F82F5A59269


## 15.2. Set Up the Networking[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#set-up-the-networking)

This section provides information about how to set up client networking for VAST for GDS.

To ensure optimal GPU-to-storage performance while leveraging GDS, you need to configure VAST and client networking in a balanced manner.

### 15.2.1. VAST Network Configuration[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#vast-network-configuration)

VAST is a multi-node architecture. Each node has multiple high-speed (IB-HDR100 or 100GbE) interfaces, which can host
client-facing Virtual IPs. Refer to [VAST-Managing Virtual IP (VIP) Pools](https://support.vastdata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016231794-Managing-Virtual-IP-VIP-Pools)
for more information.

Here is the typical workflow:

Multiply the number of VAST-Nodes * 2 (one per Interface).

Create a VIP Pool with the resulting IP count.

Place the VAST-VIP Pool on the same IP-subnet as the client.


### 15.2.2. Client Network Configuration[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#client-network-configuration)

The following is information about client network configuration.

Typically, GPU optimized clients (such as the NVIDIA DGX-2 and DGX-A100) are configured with multiple high speed network interface cards (NICs). In the following example, the system contains 8 separate NICs that were selected for optimal balance for NIC –>GPU and NIC –>CPU bandwidth.

```
$ sudo ibdev2netdev

mlx5_7 port 1 ==> ibp148s0 (Up)
mlx5_8 port 1 ==> ibp186s0 (Up)
mlx5_9 port 1 ==> ibp202s0 (Up)
```

Not all interfaces are connected, and this is to ensure optimal bandwidth.

When using the aforementioned VAST NFSoRDAM+Multipath package, it is recommended to assign static IP’s to each interface on the same subnet, which should also match the subnet configured on the VAST VIP Pool. If using GDS with NVIDIA DGX-A100s, a simplistic netplan is all that is required, for example:

```
ibp12s0:
addresses: [172.16.0.17/24]
dhcp4: no
ibp141s0:
addresses: [172.16.0.18/24]
dhcp4: no
ibp148s0:
addresses: [172.16.0.19/24]
dhcp4: no
```

However, if you are using other systems, or non-GDS code, you need to apply the following code to ensure that the proper interfaces are used to traverse from Client–>VAST.

Note

See the `routes`

section for each interface in the following sample.

```
$ cat /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
network:
version: 2
renderer: networkd
ethernets:
enp226s0:

table: 108
```

After making changes to the netplan, before issuing the following command, ensure that you have a IPMI/console connection to the client:

```
$ sudo netplan apply
```

### 15.2.3. Verify Network Connectivity[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#verify-network-connectivity)

Once the proper netplan is applied, verify connectivity between all client interfaces and all VAST-VIPs with a ping loop:

```
# Replace with appropriate interface names
$ export IFACES="ibp12s0 ibp18s0 ibp75s0 ibp84s0 ibp141s0 ibp148s0 ibp186s0 ibp202s0"
# replace with appropriate VAST-VIPs
$ export VIPS=$(echo 172.16.0.{101..116})
$ echo "starting pingtest" > pingtest.log
$ for i in $IFACES;do for v in $VIPS; do echo $i >> pingtest.log; ping -c 1 $v -W 0.2 -I $i|grep loss >> pingtest.log;done;done;
# Verify no failures:
$ grep '100%' pingtest.log
```

You should also verify that one of the following conditions are met:

All client interfaces are directly cabled to the same IB switches as VAST.

There are sufficient InterSwitch Links (ISLs) between client-switches, and switches to which VAST is connected.


To verify the current IB switch topology, issue the following command:

```
$ sudo ibnetdiscover
<output trimmed>
[37] "H-b8599f0300c3f4cb"[1](b8599f0300c3f4cb) # "vastraplab-cn1 HCA-2" lid 55 2xHDR # <-- example of Vast-Node
[43] "S-b8599f0300e361f2"[43] # "MF0;RL-QM87-C20-U33:MQM8700/U1" lid 1 4xHDR # <-- example of ISL
[67] "H-1c34da030073c27e"[1](1c34da030073c27e) # "rl-dgxa-c21-u19 mlx5_9" lid 23 4xHDR # <-- example of client
```

## 15.3. Mount VAST NFS[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#mount-vast-nfs)

To fully utilize available VAST VIPs, you must mount the file system by issuing the following command:

```
$ sudo mount -o proto=rdma,port=20049,vers=3 \
-o noidlexprt,nconnect=40 \
-o localports=172.16.0.25-172.16.0.32 \
-o remoteports=172.16.0.101-172.16.0.140 \
172.16.0.101:/ /mnt/vast
```

The options are:

- proto
RDMA must be specified.

- port=20049
Must be specified, this is RDMA control port.

- noidlexprt
Do not disconnect idle connections. This is to detect and recover failing connections when there are no pending I/Os.

- nconnect
Number of concurrent connections. Should be divisible evenly by the number of remoteports specified below for best balance.

- localports
A list of IPv4 addresses for the local ports to bind.

- remoteports
A list of NFS server IPv4 ports to bind.


For both **localports** and **remoteports** you can specify an inclusive range with the *-* delimiter, for example,
*FIRST-LAST*. Multiple ranges or individual IP addresses can be separated by *~* (a tilde)

## 15.4. Debugging and Monitoring VAST Data[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#debugging-and-monitoring-vast-data)

Typically, `mountstats`

under `/proc`

shows `xprt`

statistics. However, instead of modifying it in a non-compatible
way with the `nfsstat`

utility, the VAST Multipath package extends `mountstats`

with extra state reporting, to be
exclusively accessed from `/sys/kernel/debug`

.

The `stats`

node was added for each RPC client, and the RPC client 0 shows the mount that is completed:

```
$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/sunrpc/rpc_clnt/0/stats
```

The added information is multipath IP address information per xprt and xprt state in string format.

For example:

```
xprt: rdma 0 0 1 0 24 3 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 11 0 0 0
172.25.1.101 -> 172.25.1.1, state: CONNECTED BOUND
xprt: rdma 0 0 1 0 24 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 11 0 0 0
172.25.1.102 -> 172.25.1.2, state: CONNECTED BOUND
xprt: rdma 0 0 1 0 23 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 11 0 0 0
172.25.1.103 -> 172.25.1.3, state: CONNECTED BOUND
xprt: rdma 0 0 1 0 22 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 11 0 0 0
172.25.1.104 -> 172.25.1.4, state: CONNECTED BOUND
xprt: rdma 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
172.25.1.101 -> 172.25.1.5, state: BOUND
xprt: rdma 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
172.25.1.102 -> 172.25.1.6, state: BOUND
xprt: rdma 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
172.25.1.103 -> 172.25.1.7, state: BOUND
xprt: rdma 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
172.25.1.104 -> 172.25.1.8, state: BOUND
```

# 16. NVMe P2PDMA Troubleshooting[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#nvme-p2pdma-troubleshooting)

This section provides troubleshooting information for NVMe Support using Linux PCI P2PDMA.

## 16.1. Linux Kernel Requirements[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#linux-kernel-requirements)

Check that the Linux kernel version is newer than 6.2 and above on Ubuntu distributions.

For other distributions please check the PCI P2PDMA feature is compiled. If the PCI P2PDMA is not enabled,
GDS-specific NVMe patches can be installed from MLNX_OFED to support GDS with `nvidia-fs.ko`

.

```
$ cat /proc/kallsyms | grep -i p2pdma_pgmap_ops
0000000000000000 d p2pdma_pgmap_ops
```

Check if you have a system with NVIDIA GPU newer than or equal to NVIDIA Ampere-based architecture.

## 16.2. P2PDMA Supported GPUs[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#p2pdma-supported-gpus)

A100, A40, L4, L40S, H100, H200, B100, B200, B300 are supported.

## 16.3. Setting the Driver Registries for Enabling PCI P2PDMA[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#setting-the-driver-registries-for-enabling-pci-p2pdma)

Note

Required only on x86 platforms.

**Disable multipathing support**

NVMe Multipathing is currently not enabled with PCI P2PDMA in the upstream driver and will not work without a specialized patch.

```
$ cat /etc/modprobe.d/nvme.conf
options nvme_core multipath=N
#RH/SLES:
$ sudo dracut -f
#Ubuntu :
$ sudo update-initramfs -u -k `uname -r`
$ sudo reboot
$ cat /sys/module/nvme_core/parameters/multipath
N
```

**pci_p2pdma support (** Enable static BAR1 and force disable write combine)

Set the following parameters in driver modprobe conf settings to persist beyond reboots:

```
$ cat /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-p2pdma.conf
options nvidia NVreg_RegistryDwords="RMForceStaticBar1=1;RmForceDisableIomapWC=1;"
```

Note

For pre-Hopper GPUs (L4, L40, A100, A40), the following additional setting of ForceP2P=0 should be applied:

```
$ cat /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-p2pdma.conf
options nvidia NVreg_RegistryDwords="RMForceStaticBar1=1;\
ForceP2P=0;\
RmForceDisableIomapWC=1;"
#RH/SLES:
$ sudo dracut -f
#ubuntu :
$ sudo update-initramfs -u -k `uname -r`
# reboot
$ sudo reboot
# check the settings
$ cat /proc/driver/nvidia/params | grep -i static
RegistryDwords: "RMForceStaticBar1=1;RmForceDisableIomapWC=1;"
```

## 16.4. cufile.json Settings[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-json-settings)

Add the following config parameter to the `/etc/cufile.json`

or app-specific JSON file:

```
```
{
"properties": {
"use_pci_p2pdma": true
}
"block": {
"nvme": {
"use_pci_p2pdma": true
}
}
}
```
```

## 16.5. Verify P2P Mode is Supported by GDS[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#verify-p2p-mode-is-supported-by-gds)

```
/usr/local/cuda-<x>.<y>/gds/tools/gdscheck.py -p
GDS release version: 1.13.0.7
nvidia_fs version: 2.24 libcufile version: 2.12
Platform: x86_64
============
ENVIRONMENT:
============
=====================
DRIVER CONFIGURATION:
=====================
NVMe : p2pdma, compat
```

Note

NVMe P2PDMA mode takes precedence if NVMe is supported by both PCI P2PDMA and `nvidia-fs`

.

## 16.6. RAID Support[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#raid-support)

GDS P2PDMA for RAID devices is currently supported only on ARM platforms; x86 platforms are not supported.

## 16.7. Mounting a Local File System for GDS[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#mounting-a-local-file-system-for-gds)

Currently, EXT4 and XFS are the only block device based file systems that GDS supports. Because of Direct IO
semantics, the EXT4 file system must be mounted with the journaling mode set to `data=ordered`

. This has to
be explicitly part of the mount options so that the library can recognize it:

```
$ sudo mount -o data=ordered /dev/nvme0n1 /mnt
```

If the EXT4 journaling mode is not in the expected mode, the `cuFileHandleRegister`

will fail, and an appropriate
error message will be logged in the log file. For instance, in the following case, `/mnt1`

is mounted with writeback,
and GDS returns an error:

```
$ mount | grep /mnt1
/dev/nvme0n1p2 on /mnt1 type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=writeback)
$ ./cufile_sample_001 /mnt1/foo 0
opening file /mnt1/foo
file register error:GPUDirect Storage not supported on current file
```

## 16.8. Check for an Existing EXT4 Mount[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#check-for-an-existing-ext4-mount)

To check for an existing EXT4 mount:

```
$ mount | grep ext4
/dev/sda2 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)
/dev/nvme1n1 on /mnt type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
/dev/nvme0n1p2 on /mnt1 type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=writeback)
```

Note

A similar check can be used to check for an existing XFS mount, for example:

```
mount | grep xfs
```

## 16.9. Check for IO Statistics with Block Device Mount[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#check-for-io-statistics-with-block-device-mount)

The following command and partial log show you how to obtain the IO statistics:

```
$ sudo iotop
Actual DISK READ: 0.00 B/s | Actual DISK WRITE: 193.98 K/s
TID PRIO USER DISK READ DISK WRITE SWAPIN IO> COMMAND
881 be/3 root 0.00 B/s 15.52 K/s 0.00 % 0.01 % [jbd2/sda2-8]
1 be/4 root 0.00 B/s 0.00 B/s 0.00 % 0.00 % init splash
```

## 16.10. Conduct a Basic EXT4 File System Test[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#conduct-a-basic-ext4-file-system-test)

To conduct a basic EXT4 file system test, issue the following command:

```
$ /usr/local/cuda-x.y/gds/tools/gdsio_verify -f /mnt/nvme/gdstest/tests/reg1G -n 1 -m 0 -s 1024 -o 0 -d 0 -t 0 -S -g 4K
```

Sample output:

```
gpu index :0,file :/mnt/weka/gdstest/tests/reg1G, RING buffer size :0, gpu buffer alignment :4096, gpu buffer offset :0, file offset :0, io_requested :1024, bufregister :false, sync :0, nr ios :1,fsync :0,
address = 0x564ffc5e76c0
Data Verification Success
```

## 16.11. Unmount an EXT4 File System[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#unmount-an-ext4-file-system)

To unmount an EXT4 file system, issue the following command:

```
$ sudo umount /mnt/
```

## 16.12. Udev Device Naming for a Block Device[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#udev-device-naming-for-a-block-device)

The library has a limitation when identifying the NVMe-based block devices in that it expects device
names to have the `nvme`

prefix as part of the naming convention.

## 16.13. BATCH I/O Performance[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#batch-i-o-performance)

It has been observed that m separate batches with n/m entries each, showed better performance than 1 batch with n entries especially in case of NVMe based storage.

## 16.14. Statistics[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#statistics)

There are no separate statistics for differentiating between PCI P2PDMA mode and nvidia-fs mode. The GDS mode stats are common for both these modes and should be differentiated based on the mode the application is operating on.

# 17. NVMe and NVMe-oF Troubleshooting[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#nvme-and-nvme-of-troubleshooting)

This section provides troubleshooting information for NVME and NVMeOF support.

## 17.1. Storage Transport Requirements[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#storage-transport-requirements)

To enable GDS support for NVMe, NVMe over Fabrics, or NFS over RDMA, install the required storage transport packages by using one of the following options:

If MLNX_OFED is already installed in your environment, follow

[MLNX_OFED Requirements and Installation](https://docs.nvidia.com#mofed-req-install).For new installations, NVIDIA recommends using DOCA. Follow

[DOCA Requirements and Installation](https://docs.nvidia.com#doca-requirements-and-installation).

Do not install both MLNX_OFED and DOCA storage transport packages on the same system unless instructed by NVIDIA support.

## 17.2. MLNX_OFED Requirements and Installation[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#mlnx-ofed-requirements-and-installation)

Use this section only if MLNX_OFED is already installed in your environment or if your deployment specifically requires MLNX_OFED.

To enable GDS support for NVMe and NVMe over Fabrics, install MLNX_OFED 5.3 or later with GDS support.

Run the following command to install MLNX_OFED with the required options:

```
$ sudo ./mlnxofedinstall --with-nvmf --with-nfsrdma --enable-gds --add-kernel-support --dkms
```

Note

With MLNX_OFED 5.3 and later, the `--enable-gds`

flag is no longer
required.

After the installation is complete, update initramfs and reboot the system for the changes to take effect.

```
$ sudo update-initramfs -u -k `uname -r`
$ sudo reboot
```

The Linux kernel versions tested with MLNX_OFED 5.3-1.0.5.01 are 4.15.0-x and 5.4.0-x.

## 17.3. DOCA Requirements and Installation[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#doca-requirements-and-installation)

For new GDS installations, NVIDIA recommends using DOCA to install the required storage transport packages for NVMe and NVMe over Fabrics.

This section is not required if you already installed GDS support by using
MLNX_OFED as described in [MLNX_OFED Requirements and Installation](https://docs.nvidia.com#mofed-req-install).

For general DOCA host installation instructions, see
[Installing Software on Host](https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/sdk/nvidia+doca+installation+guide+for+linux/index.html#src-3095334759_id-.NVIDIADOCAInstallationGuideforLinuxv2.9.0LTS-InstallingSoftwareonHost).

If your system does not use a supported host OS or kernel, install the required DOCA extra packages as described in the DOCA installation guide. Then install the NVMe and NVMe over Fabrics packages for your operating system.

**For Ubuntu:**

```
$ sudo apt install doca-ofed mlnx-fw-updater mlnx-nvme-dkms
$ sudo update-initramfs -u -k `uname -r`
$ sudo reboot
```

**For RHEL:**

```
$ sudo dnf install doca-ofed mlnx-fw-updater kmod-mlnx-nvme
$ sudo dracut -f
$ sudo reboot
```

Note

For supported host operating systems and installation profiles, see
[Supported Host OS and Features per DOCA-Host Installation Profile](https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/sdk/General+Support#src-3201691572_id-.GeneralSupportv2.9.0LTS-SupportedHostOSandFeaturesperDOCA-HostInstallationProfile).

## 17.4. Determining Whether the NVMe device is Supported for GDS[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#determining-whether-the-nvme-device-is-supported-for-gds)

NVMe devices must be compatible with GDS; the device cannot have the block device integrity capability.

For device integrity, the Linux block layer completes the metadata processing based on the payload in the host memory.
This is a deviation from the standard GDS IO path and, as a result, cannot accommodate these devices. The cuFile file
registration will fail when this type of underlying device is detected with appropriate error log in the `cufile.log`

file.

```
$ cat /sys/block/<nvme>/integrity/device_is_integrity_capable
```

## 17.5. RAID Support in GDS[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#raid-support-in-gds)

Currently, GDS only supports RAID 0.

## 17.6. Mounting a Local File System for GDS[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#mounting-a-local-filesystem-for-gds-1)

Currently, EXT4 and XFS are the only block device based file system that GDS supports. Because of Direct IO
semantics, the ext4 file system must be mounted with the journaling mode set to `data=ordered`

. This has
to be explicitly part of the mount options so that the library can recognize it:

```
$ sudo mount -o data=ordered /dev/nvme0n1 /mnt
```

If the EXT4 journaling mode is not in the expected mode, the `cuFileHandleRegister`

will fail, and an appropriate error
message will be logged in the log file. For instance, in the following case, `/mnt1`

is mounted with writeback, and GDS
returns an error:

```
$ mount | grep /mnt1
/dev/nvme0n1p2 on /mnt1 type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=writeback)
$ ./cufile_sample_001 /mnt1/foo 0
opening file /mnt1/foo
file register error:GPUDirect Storage not supported on current file
```

## 17.7. Check for an Existing EXT4 Mount[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#check-for-an-existing-ext4-mount-1)

To check for an existing EXT4 mount:

```
$ mount | grep ext4
/dev/sda2 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)
/dev/nvme1n1 on /mnt type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
/dev/nvme0n1p2 on /mnt1 type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=writeback)
```

Note

A similar check can be used to check for an existing XFS mount, for example:

```
mount | grep xfs
```

## 17.8. Check for IO Statistics with Block Device Mount[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#check-for-io-statistics-with-block-device-mount-1)

The following command and partial log show you how to obtain the IO statistics:

```
$ sudo iotop
Actual DISK READ: 0.00 B/s | Actual DISK WRITE: 193.98 K/s
TID PRIO USER DISK READ DISK WRITE SWAPIN IO> COMMAND
881 be/3 root 0.00 B/s 15.52 K/s 0.00 % 0.01 % [jbd2/sda2-8]
1 be/4 root 0.00 B/s 0.00 B/s 0.00 % 0.00 % init splash
```

## 17.9. RAID Group Configuration for GPU Affinity[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#raid-group-configuration-for-gpu-affinity)

Creating one RAID group from the available NVMe devices might not be optimal for GDS performance. You might need to create RAID groups that consist of devices that have a pci-affinity with the specified GPU. This is required to prevent and cross-node P2P traffic between the GPU and the NVMe devices.

If affinity is not enforced, GDS will use an internal mechanism of device bounce buffers to copy data from the NVMe devices to an intermediate device that is closest to the drives and copy the data back to the actual GPU. If NVLink is enabled, this will speed up these transfers.

## 17.10. Conduct a Basic EXT4 File System Test[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#conduct-a-basic-ext4-filesystem-test-1)

To conduct a basic EXT4 file system test, issue the following command:

```
$ /usr/local/cuda-x.y/gds/tools/gdsio_verify -f /mnt/nvme/gdstest/tests/reg1G -n 1 -m 0 -s 1024 -o 0 -d 0 -t 0 -S -g 4K
```

Sample output:

```
gpu index :0,file :/mnt/weka/gdstest/tests/reg1G, RING buffer size :0, gpu buffer alignment :4096, gpu buffer offset :0, file offset :0, io_requested :1024, bufregister :false, sync :0, nr ios :1,fsync :0,
address = 0x564ffc5e76c0

## 17.12. Udev Device Naming for a Block Device[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#udev-device-naming-for-a-block-device-1)

The library has a limitation when identifying the NVMe-based block devices in that it expects device names to have the `nvme`

prefix as part of the naming convention.

## 17.13. BATCH I/O Performance[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#batch-io-performance-1)

It has been observed that m separate batches with n/m entries each, showed better performance than 1 batch with n entries especially in case of NVMe based storage.

# 18. Displaying GDS NVIDIA FS Driver Statistics[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#displaying-gds-nvidia-fs-driver-statistics)

## 18.2. Analyze Statistics for Each GPU[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#analyze-statistics-for-each-gpu)

You can analyze the statistics for each GPU to better understand what is happening in that GPU.

Consider the following example output:

```
GPU 0000:5e:00:0 uuid:dc87fe99-4d68-247b-b5d2-63f96d2adab1 : pinned_MB=0 cache_MB=0 max_pinned_MB=79
GPU 0000:b7:00:0 uuid:b3a6a195-d08c-09d1-bf8f-a5423c277c04 : pinned_MB=0 cache_MB=0 max_pinned_MB=76
GPU 0000:e7:00:0 uuid:7c432aed-a612-5b18-76e7-402bb48f21db : pinned_MB=0 cache_MB=0 max_pinned_MB=80
GPU 0000:57:00:0 uuid:aa871613-ee53-9a0c-a546-851d1afe4140 : pinned_MB=0 cache_MB=0 max_pinned_MB=80
```

In this sample output, `0000:5e:00:0`

, is the PCI BDF of the GPU with the `Dc87fe99-4d68-247b-b5d2-63f96d2adab1`

UUID. This is the same UUID that can be used to observe `nvidia-smi`

statistics for this GPU.

Here is some additional information about the statistics:

`pinned-MB`

shows the active GPU memory that is pinned by using`nvidia_p2p_get_pages`

from the GDS driver in MB across all active processes.`cache_MB`

shows the active GPU memory that is pinned by using`nvidia_p2p_get_pages`

, but this memory is used as the internal cache by GDS across all active processes.`max_pinned_MB`

shows the max GPU memory that is pinned by GDS at any point in time on this GPU across multiple processes.This value indicates that the max BAR size and administrator can be used for system sizing purposes.


## 18.3. Resetting the nvidia-fs Statistics[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#resetting-the-nvidia-fs-statistics)

To reset the `nvidia-fs`

statistics, run the following commands:

```
$ sudo bash
$ echo 1 >/proc/driver/nvidia-fs/stats
```

## 18.4. Checking Peer Affinity Stats for a Kernel File System and Storage Drivers[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-peer-affinity-stats-for-a-kernel-file-system-and-storage-drivers)

The following `proc`

files contain information about peer affinity DMA statistics via `nvidia-fs`

callbacks:

`nvidia-fs`

/`stats`

`nvidia-fs`

/`peer_affinity`

`nvidia-fs`

/`peer_distance`


To enable the statistics, run the following command:

```
$ sudo bash
$ echo 1 > /sys/module/nvidia_fs/parameters/peer_stats_enabled
```

To view consolidated statistics as a regular user, run the following command:

```
$ cat /proc/driver/nvidia-fs/stats
```

Sample output:

```

The `cross_root_port (%)`

port is the percentage of total DMA traffic through `nvidia-fs`

callbacks, and
this value spans across PCIe root ports between GPU and its peers such as HCA.

This can be a major reason for low throughput on certain platforms.

This does not consider the DMA traffic that is initiated via

`cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice`

or`cuMemcpyPeer`

with the specified GPU.

## 18.5. Checking the Peer Affinity Usage for a Kernel File System and Storage Drivers[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-the-peer-affinity-usage-for-a-kernel-file-system-and-storage-drivers)

To get the peer affinity usage for a kernel file system and storage drivers, run the following command:

$ cat /proc/driver/nvidia-fs/peer_affinity

Review the sample output, for example:

Each row represents a GPU entry, and the columns indicate the peer ranks in ascending order. The lower the rank, the better the affinity. Each column entry is the total number of DMA transactions that occurred between the specified GPU and the peers that belong to the same rank.

For example, the row with `GPU 0000:34:00.0`

has `2621440`

IO operations through the peer with rank 3.
Non-zero values in the last column indicate that the IO is routed through the root complex.

Here are some examples:

Run the following command:

```
$ /usr/local/cuda-x.y/gds/samples /mnt/lustre/test 0
$ cat /proc/driver/nvidia-fs/stats

```

In the above example, there are DMA transactions between the GPU (`34:00.0`

) and one of its peers. The peer
device has the highest possible rank which indicates it is farthest away from the respective GPU pci-distance wise.

To check the percentage of traffic, check the `cross_root_ port %`

in `/proc/driver/nvidia-fs/stats`

. In
the third example above, this value is `100%`

, which means that the peer-to peer-traffic is happening over QPI links.

## 18.6. Display the GPU-to-Peer Distance Table[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#display-the-gpu-to-peer-distance-table)

The `peer_distance`

table displays the device-wise IO distribution for each peer with its rank for the
specified GPU, and it complements the rank-based stats.

The peer_distance table displays the device-wise IO distribution for each peer with its rank for the specified GPU. It complements the rank-based stats.

The ranking is done in the following order:

Primary priority given to p2p distance (upper 2 bytes).

Secondary priority is given to the device bandwidth (lower 2 bytes)


For peer paths that cross the root port, a fixed cost for p2p distance (127) is added. This is done to induce a preference for paths under one CPU root port relative to paths that cross the CPU root ports.

Issue the following command:

```
$ cat /proc/driver/nvidia-fs/peer_distance
```

Sample output:

```

## 18.7. The GDSIO Tool[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#the-gdsio-tool)

GDSIO is a synthetic IO benchmarking tool that uses cufile APIs for IO. The tool can be found in the
`/usr/local/cuda-x.y/tools`

directory. For more information about how to use this tool, run
`/usr/local/cuda-x.y/tools/gdsio -h`

or review the *gdsio* section in the `/usr/local/cuda-x.y/tools/README`

file. In the examples below, the files are created on an ext4 file system.

Issue the following command:

```
# ./gdsio -f /root/sg/test -d 0 -w 4 -s 1M -x 0 -i 4K:32K:1K -I 1
```

Sample output:

```
IoType: WRITE XferType: GPUD Threads: 4 DataSetSize: 671/1024(KiB)
IOSize: 4-32-1(KiB) Throughput: 0.044269 GiB/sec, Avg_Latency:
996.094925 usecs ops: 60 total_time 0.014455 secs
```

This command does a write IO (`-I 1`

) on a file named test of size 1MiB (`-s 1M`

) with an IO size that varies
between 4KiB to 32 KiB in steps of 1KiB (-i 4K:32K:1K). The transfer is performed using GDS (`-x 0`

) using
4 threads (`-w 4`

) on GPU 0 (`-d 0`

).

Some additional features of the tool are:

Support for read/write at random offsets in a file.

The gdsio tool provides options to perform a read and write to a file at random offsets.

Using -I 2 and -I 3 options does a file read and write operation at random offset respectively but the random offsets are always 4KiB aligned.

# ./gdsio -f /root/sg/test -d 0 -w 4 -s 1M -x 0 -i 4K:32K:1K -I 3 IoType: RANDWRITE XferType: GPUD Threads: 4 DataSetSize: 706/1024(KiB) IOSize: 4-32-1(KiB) Throughput: 0.079718 GiB/sec, Avg_Latency: 590.853274 usecs ops: 44 total_time 0.008446 secs

To perform a random read and write at unaligned 4KiB offsets, the

`-U`

option can be used with`-I 0`

or`-I 1`

for read and write, respectively.# ./gdsio -f /root/sg/test -d 0 -w 4 -s 1M -x 0 -i 4K:32K:1K -I 1 -U IoType: RANDWRITE XferType: GPUD Threads: 4 DataSetSize: 825/1024(KiB) IOSize: 4-32-1(KiB) Throughput: 0.055666 GiB/sec, Avg_Latency: 919.112500 usecs ops: 49 total_time 0.014134 secs

Random buffer fill for dedupe and compression.

Using the

`-R`

option fills the io size buffer (`-i`

) with random data. This random data is then written to the file onto different file offsets.# ./gdsio -f /root/sg/test -d 0 -w 4 -s 1M -x 0 -i 4K:32K:1K -I 1 -R IoType: WRITE XferType: GPUD Threads: 4 DataSetSize: 841/1024(KiB) IOSize: 4-32-1(KiB) Throughput: 0.059126 GiB/sec, Avg_Latency: 788.884580 usecs ops: 69 total_time 0.013565 secs

Using the

`-F`

option will fill the entire file with random data.# ./gdsio -f /root/sg/test -d 0 -w 4 -s 1M -x 0 -i 4K:32K:1K -I 1 -F IoType: WRITE XferType: GPUD Threads: 4 DataSetSize: 922/1024(KiB) IOSize: 4-32-1(KiB) Throughput: 0.024376 GiB/sec, Avg_Latency: 1321.104532 usecs ops: 73 total_time 0.036072 secs

This is useful for file systems that use dedupe and compression algorithms to minimize disk access. Using random data increases the probability that these file systems will hit the backend disk more often.


Variable block size.

To perform a read or a write on a file, you can specify the block size (- i), which says that IO would be performed in chunks of block sized lengths. To check the stats for what block sizes are used use the

`gds_stats`

tool. Ensure the the`/etc/cufile.json`

file has cufile_stats is set to 3:# ./gds_stats -p <pid of the gdsio process> -l 3

Sample output:

0-4(KiB): 0 0 4-8(KiB): 0 17205 8-16(KiB): 0 45859 16-32(KiB): 0 40125 32-64(KiB): 0 0 64-128(KiB): 0 0 128-256(KiB): 0 0 256-512(KiB): 0 0 512-1024(KiB): 0 0 1024-2048(KiB): 0 0 2048-4096(KiB): 0 0 4096-8192(KiB): 0 0 8192-16384(KiB): 0 0 16384-32768(KiB): 0 0 32768-65536(KiB): 0 0 65536-...(KiB): 0 0

The highlighted counters show that, for the command above, the block sizes that are used for file IO are in the 4-32 KiB range.

Verification mode usage and limitations.

To ensure data integrity, there is an option to perform IO in a Write and Read in verify mode using the

`-V`

option. Here is an example:# ./gdsio -V -f /root/sg/test -d 0 -w 1 -s 2G -o 0 -x 0 -k 0 -i 4K:32K:1K -I 1 IoType: WRITE XferType: GPUD Threads: 1 DataSetSize: 2097144/2097152(KiB) IOSize: 4-32-1(KiB) Throughput: 0.074048 GiB/sec, Avg_Latency: 231.812570 usecs ops: 116513 total_time 27.009349 secs Verifying data IoType: READ XferType: GPUD Threads: 1 DataSetSize: 2097144/2097152(KiB) IOSize: 4-32-1(KiB) Throughput: 0.103465 GiB/sec, Avg_Latency: 165.900663 usecs ops: 116513 total_time 19.330184 secs

The command above will perform a write followed by a read verify test.

While using the verify mode, remember the following points:

read test (-I 0) with verify option (

`-V`

) should be used with files written (-I 1) with the`-V`

optionread test (-I 2) with verify option (

`-V`

) should be used with files written (-I 3) with the`-V`

option and using same random seed (`-k`

) using same number of threads, offset, and data sizewrite test (-I 1/3) with verify option (

`-V`

) will perform writes followed by read.Verify mode cannot be used in timed mode (

`-T`

option).If Verify mode is used in a timed mode, it will be ignored.


The configuration file

GDSIO has an option to configure the parameters that are needed to perform an IO in a configuration file and run the IO using those configurations. The configuration file gives the option of performing multiple jobs, where each job has some different configurations.

The configuration file has global parameters and job specific parameter support. For example, with a configuration file, you can configure each job to perform on a GPU and with a different number of threads. The global parameters, such as IO Size and transfer mode, remain the same for each job. For more information, refer to

`/usr/local/cuda-x.y/tools/README`

and`/usr/local/cuda-x.y/tools/rw-sample.gdsio`

files. After configuring the parameters, to perform the IO operation using the configuration file, run the following command:# ./gdsio <config file name>


See [Tabulated Fields](https://docs.nvidia.com#tabulated-fields) for a list of the tabulated fields.

## 18.8. Tabulated Fields[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#tabulated-fields)

## 18.9. GDSCHECK Tool[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gdscheck-tool)

The `/usr/local/cuda-x.y/tools/gdscheck.py`

tool is used to perform a GDS platform check and has other options that can be found by using `-h`

option.

```
$ ./gdscheck.py -h

### 18.10.2. Install GPUDirect Storage Support for the NFS Client[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#install-gpudirect-storage-support-for-the-nfs-client)

To install a NFS client with GDS support complete the following steps:

Note

The client must have a Mellanox connect-X4/5 NIC with MLNX_OFED 5.3 or later installed.

Issue the following command:

$ ofed_info -s MLNX_OFED_LINUX-5.3-1.0.5.0:

## 18.11. NFS GPUDirect Storage Statistics and Debugging[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#nfs-gpudirect-storage-statistics-and-debugging)

NFS IO can be observed using regular Linux tools that are used for monitoring IO, such as `iotop`

and `nfsstat`

.

To enable NFS RPC stats debugging, run the following command:

$ rpcdebug -v

To observer GDS-related IO stats, run the following command:

$ cat /proc/driver/nvidia-fs/stats

To determine GDS statistics per process, run the following command:

$ /usr/local/cuda-x.y/tools/gds_stats -p <PID> -l 3


## 18.12. GPUDirect Storage IO Behavior[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gpudirect-storage-io-behavior)

This section provides information about IO behavior in GDS.

### 18.12.1. Read/Write Atomicity Consistency with GPUDirect Storage Direct IO[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#read-write-atomicity-consistency-with-gpudirect-storage-direct-io)

In GDS, the `max_direct_io_size_kb`

property controls the IO unit size in which the limitation is issued to the
underlying file system. By default, this value is 16MB. This implies that from a Linux VFS perspective, the atomicity
of size is limited to the `max_direct_io_size_kb`

size and not the original request size. This limitation exists
in the standard GDS path and in compatible mode.

### 18.12.2. Write with File a Opened in O_APPEND Mode (cuFileWrite)[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#write-with-file-a-opened-in-o-append-mode-cufilewrite)

For a file that is opened in O_APPEND mode with concurrent writers, if the IO size that is used is larger than the
`max_direct_io_size_kb`

property, because of the write atomicity limitations, the file might have interleaved data
from multiple writers. This cannot be prevented even if the underlying file-system has locking guarantees.

### 18.12.3. GPU to NIC Peer Affinity[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gpu-to-nic-peer-affinity)

The library maintains a peer affinity table that is a pci-distance-based ranking for a GPU and the available NICs in the platform for RDMA. Currently, the limitation in the ranking does not consider NUMA attributes for the NICs. For a NIC that does not share a common root port with a GPU, the P2P traffic might get routed cross socket over QPI links even if there is a NIC that resides on the same CPU socket as the GPU.

### 18.12.4. Compatible Mode with Unregistered Buffers[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#compatible-mode-with-unregistered-buffers)

Currently, in compatible mode, the IO path with non-registered buffers does not have optimal performance and does buffer allocation and deallocation in every cuFileRead or cuFileWrite.

### 18.12.5. Unaligned writes with Non-Registered Buffers[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#unaligned-writes-with-non-registered-buffers)

For unaligned writes, using unregistered buffers performance may not be optimal as compared to registered buffers.

### 18.12.6. Process Hang with NFS[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#process-hang-with-nfs)

A process hang is observed in NFS environments when the application crashes.

### 18.12.7. Tools Support Limitations for CUDA 9 and Earlier[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#tools-support-limitations-for-cuda-9-and-earlier)

The gdsio binary has been built against CUDA runtime 10.1 and has a dependency on the CUDA runtime environment to be equal to version 10.1 or later. Otherwise, a driver dependency error will be reported by the tool.

## 18.13. GDS Statistics for Dynamic Routing[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gds-statistics-for-dynamic-routing)

Dynamic Routing decisions are performed at I/O operation granularity. The GDS User-space Statistics contain a per-GPU counter to indicate the number of I/Os that have been routed using Dynamic Routing.

Entry |
Description |
|---|---|
|
Number of |

There are existing counters in the `PER_GPU POOL BUFFER STATS`

and `PER_GPU POSIX POOL BUFFER STATS`

from which a user can infer the GPUs that are chosen by dynamic routing for use as the bounce buffers.

### 18.13.1. Peer Affinity Dynamic Routing[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#peer-affinity-dynamic-routing)

Dynamic Routing decisions are performed at I/O operation granularity. The GDS User-space Statistics contain a per-GPU counter to indicate the number of I/Os that have been routed using Dynamic Routing.

Entry |
Description |
|---|---|
|
Number of |

There are existing counters in the `PER_GPU POOL BUFFER STATS`

and `PER_GPU POSIX POOL BUFFER STATS`

from which a user can infer the GPUs that are chosen by dynamic routing for use as the bounce buffers.

# 19. GDS Library Tracing[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gds-library-tracing)

The GDS Library has USDT (static tracepoints), which can be used with Linux tools such as `lttng`

,
`bcc`

/`bpf`

, `perf`

. This section assumes familiarity with these tools.

The examples in this section show tracing by using the ``bcc`

/`bpf`

<[iovisor/bcc](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc)>`__
tracing facility. GDS does not ship these tracing tools. Refer to [Installing BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
for more information about installing bcc/bpf tools. Users must have root privileges to install.

Note

The user must also have `sudo`

access to use these tools.

## 19.1. Example: Display Tracepoints[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-display-tracepoints)

To display tracepoints, run the following command:

# ./tplist -l /usr/local/gds/lib/libcufile.so

Review the output, for example:

/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so cufio:cufio_px_read /usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so cufio:cufio_rdma_read /usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so cufio:cufio_gds_read /usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so cufio:cufio_gds_read_async /usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so cufio:cufio_px_write /usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so cufio:cufio_gds_write /usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so cufio:cufio_gds_write_async /usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so cufio-internal:cufio-internal-write-bb /usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so cufio-internal:cufio-internal-read-bb /usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so cufio-internal:cufio-internal-bb-done /usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so cufio-internal:cufio-internal-io-done /usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so cufio-internal:cufio-internal-map

`gdsio`

issues `READS`

to 4 files with fd=87, 88,89, 74 to GPU 2, 1, 0, and 3 and with `IO-SIZE`

of 128K, 64K, 8K, and 4K.

## 19.6. Determine the IOPS and Bandwidth for a Process in a GPU[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#determine-the-iops-and-bandwidth-for-a-process-in-a-gpu)

You can determine the IOPS and bandwidth for each process in a GPU.

Run the following command.

#./argdist -C 'u:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cufio_gds_read():int,int,size_t:arg1, arg6,arg3:arg6==0||arg6==3#IO Size Distribution arg1=fd, arg6=GPU# arg3=IOSize' -p `pgrep -n gdsio`

Review the output.

[17:49:33] u:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cufio_gds_read():int,int,size_t:arg1,arg6,arg3:arg6==0||arg6==3#IO Size Distribution arg1=fd, arg6=GPU# arg3=IOSize COUNT EVENT 9826 arg1 = 89, arg6 = 0, arg3 = 8192 11168 arg1 = 86, arg6 = 3, arg3 = 4096 [17:49:34] u:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cufio_gds_read():int,int,size_t:arg1,arg6,arg3:arg6==0||arg6==3#IO Size Distribution arg1=fd, arg6=GPU# arg3=IOSize COUNT EVENT 9815 arg1 = 89, arg6 = 0, arg3 = 8192 11141 arg1 = 86, arg6 = 3, arg3 = 4096 [17:49:35] u:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cufio_gds_read():int,int,size_t:arg1,arg6,arg3:arg6==0||arg6==3#IO Size Distribution arg1=fd, arg6=GPU# arg3=IOSize COUNT EVENT 9914 arg1 = 89, arg6 = 0, arg3 = 8192 11194 arg1 = 86, arg6 = 3, arg3 = 4096


gdsio is doing IO on all 4 GPUs, and the output is filtered for GPU 0 and GPU 3.

Bandwidth per GPU is GPU 0 - 9826 IOPS of 8K block size, and the bandwidth = ~80MB/s .


## 19.7. Display the Frequency of Reads by Processes that Issue cuFileRead[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#display-the-frequency-of-reads-by-processes-that-issue-cufileread)

You can display information about the frequency of reads by process that issue the `cuFileRead`

API.

Run the following command.

#./argdist -C 'r:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileRead():u32:$PID'

Review the output, for example:

[17:58:01] r:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileRead():u32:$PID COUNT EVENT 31191 $PID = 60492 31281 $PID = 60593 [17:58:02] r:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileRead():u32:$PID COUNT EVENT 11741 $PID = 60669 30447 $PID = 60593 30670 $PID = 60492 [17:58:03] r:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileRead():u32:$PID COUNT EVENT 29887 $PID = 60593 29974 $PID = 60669 30017 $PID = 60492 [17:58:04] r:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileRead():u32:$PID COUNT EVENT 29972 $PID = 60593 30062 $PID = 60492 30068 $PID = 60669


## 19.8. Display the Frequency of Reads when cuFileRead Takes More than 0.1 ms[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#display-the-frequency-of-reads-when-cufileread-takes-more-than-0-1-ms)

You can display the frequency of reads when the `cuFileRead`

API takes more than 0.1 ms.

Run the following command.

#./argdist -C 'r:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileRead():u32:$PID:$latency > 100000'

Review the output, for example:

[18:07:35] r:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileRead():u32:$PID:$latency > 100000 COUNT EVENT 17755 $PID = 60772 [18:07:36] r:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileRead():u32:$PID:$latency > 100000 COUNT EVENT 17884 $PID = 60772 [18:07:37] r:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileRead():u32:$PID:$latency > 100000 COUNT EVENT 17748 $PID = 60772 [18:07:38] r:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileRead():u32:$PID:$latency > 100000 COUNT EVENT 17898 $PID = 60772 [18:07:39] r:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileRead():u32:$PID:$latency > 100000 COUNT EVENT 17811 $PID = 60772


## 19.9. Displaying the Latency of cuFileRead for Each Process[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#displaying-the-latency-of-cufileread-for-each-process)

You can display the latency of the the `cuFileRead`

API for each process.

Run the following command.

#./funclatency /usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileRead -i 1 -T -u

Review the output, for example:

Tracing 1 functions for "/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileRead"... Hit Ctrl-C to end.

Here are two process with PID 60999 and PID 60894 that are issuing cuFileRead:

## 19.10. Example: Tracking the Processes that Issue cuFileBufRegister[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-tracking-the-processes-that-issue-cufilebufregister)

This example shows you can track processes that issue the `cuFileBufRegister`

API.

Run the following command:

# ./trace 'u:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cufio-internal-map "GPU %d Size %d Bounce-Buffer %d",arg1,arg2,arg5'

Review the output, for example:

PID TID COMM FUNC - 62624 62624 gdsio_verify cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 Bounce-Buffer 1 62659 62726 fio cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 8192 Bounce-Buffer 0 62659 62728 fio cufio-internal-map GPU 2 Size 131072 Bounce-Buffer 0 62659 62727 fio cufio-internal-map GPU 1 Size 65536 Bounce-Buffer 0 62659 62725 fio cufio-internal-map GPU 3 Size 4096 Bounce-Buffer 0


`gdsio_verify`

issued an IO, but it did not register GPU memory using `cuFileBufRegister`

. As a result, the GDS library pinned 1M of a bounce buffer on GPU 0. FIO, on the other hand, issued a `cuFileBufRegister`

of 128K on GPU 2.

## 19.11. Example: Tracking Whether the Process is Constant when Invoking cuFileBufRegister[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-tracking-whether-the-process-is-constant-when-invoking-cufilebufregister)

You can track whether the process is constant when invoking the `cuFileBufRegister`

API.

Run the following command:

# ./trace 'u:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cufio-internal-map (arg5 == 0) "GPU %d Size %d",arg1,arg2'

Review the output, for example:

PID TID COMM FUNC - 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576 444 472 cufile_sample_0 cufio-internal-map GPU 0 Size 1048576


As seen in this example, there is one thread in a process that continuously issues 1M of `cuFileBufRegister`

on GPU 0. This might mean that the API is called in a loop and might impact performance.

Note

`cuFileBufRegister`

involves pinning GPU memory, which is an expensive operation.

## 19.12. Example: Monitoring IOs that are Going Through the Bounce Buffer[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-monitoring-ios-that-are-going-through-the-bounce-buffer)

This example shows how you can monitor whether IOs are going through the bounce buffer.

Run the following command:

# ./trace 'u:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cufio-internal-bb-done "Application GPU %d Bounce-Buffer GPU %d Transfer Size %d Unaligned %d Registered %d", arg2,arg3,arg8,arg9,arg10'

Review the output, for example:


```
PID TID COMM FUNC -
1013 1041 gdsio App-GPU 0 Bounce-Buffer GPU 0 Transfer Size 1048576 Unaligned 1 Registered 0
1013 1042 gdsio App-GPU 3 Bounce-Buffer GPU 3 Transfer Size 1048576 Unaligned 1 Registered 0
1013 1041 gdsio App-GPU 0 Bounce-Buffer GPU 0 Transfer Size 1048576 Unaligned 1 Registered 0
1013 1042 gdsio App-GPU 3 Bounce-Buffer GPU 3 Transfer Size 1048576 Unaligned 1 Registered 0
The ``gdsio`` app has 2 threads and both are doing unaligned IO on GPU 0 and GPU 3. Since the IO is unaligned, bounce buffers are also from the same application GPU.
```

## 19.13. Example: Tracing cuFileRead and cuFileWrite Failures, Print, Error Codes, and Time of Failure[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-tracing-cufileread-and-cufilewrite-failures-print-error-codes-and-time-of-failure)

This example shows you how to trace the `cuFileRead`

and `cuFileWrite`

failures, print, error codes, and time of failure.

Run the following command:

# ./trace 'r:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileRead ((int)retval < 0) "cuFileRead failed: %d", retval' 'r:/usr/local/cuda-x.y/lib/libcufile.so:cuFileWrite ((int)retval < 0) "cuFileWrite failed: %d", retval' -T

Review the output, for example:

TIME PID TID COMM FUNC - 23:22:16 4201 4229 gdsio cuFileRead cuFileRead failed: -5 23:22:42 4237 4265 gdsio cuFileWrite cuFileWrite failed: -5


In this example, two failures were observed with EIO (-5) as the return code with the timestamp.

## 19.14. Example: User-Space Statistics for Each GDS Process[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-user-space-statistics-for-each-gds-process)

The `cuFile`

library exports user-level statistics in the form of API level counters for each process.
In addition to the regular GDS IO path, there are paths for user-space file-systems and IO compatibility
modes that use POSIX read/writes, which do not go through the nvidia-fs driver. The user-level statistics
are more useful in these scenarios.

There is a verbosity level for the counters which users can specify using JSON configuration file to enable and set the level. The following describes various verbosity levels.

Level |
Description |
|---|---|
Level 0 |
cuFile stats will be disabled. |
Level 1 |
cuFile stats will report only Global Counters like overall throughput, average latency and error counts. |
Level 2 |
With the Global Counters, an IO Size histogram will be reported for information on access patterns. |
Level 3 |
At this level, per GPU counters are reported and also live usage of cuFile internal pool buffers. |

The following is the JSON configuration key to enable GDS statistics by using the `/etc/cufile.json`

file:

```
"profile": {
// cufile stats level(0-3)
"cufile_stats": 3
},
```

## 19.15. Example: Viewing GDS User-Level Statistics for a Process[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-viewing-gds-user-level-statistics-for-a-process)

This example shows how you can use the `gds_stats`

tool to display user-level statistics for a process.

**Prerequisite**: Before you run the tool, ensure that the IO application is active, and the `gds_stats`

has the same user permissions as the application.

The `gds_stats`

tool can be used to read statistics that are exported by `libcufile.so`

.

The output of the statistics is displayed in the standard output. If the user permissions are not the same,
there might not be sufficient privilege to view the stats. A future version of `gds_stats`

will integrate
`nvidia-fs`

kernel level statistics into this tool.

To use the tool, run the following command:

```
$ /usr/local/cuda-x.y/tools/gds_stats -p <pidof application> -l <stats_level(1-3)>
```

When specifying the statistics level, ensure that the corresponding level (`profile.cufile_stats`

)
is also enabled in the `/etc/cufile.json`

file.

The GDS user level statistics are logged once to `cufile.log`

file when the library is shut down,
or the `cuFileDriverClose`

API is run. To view statistics in the log file, set the log level to INFO.

## 19.16. Example: Displaying Sample User-Level Statistics for Each GDS Process[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-displaying-sample-user-level-statistics-for-each-gds-process)

This example shows how to display sample user-level statistics for each GDS process.

## 20.1. Distribution of IO Usage in Each GPU[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#distribution-of-io-usage-in-each-gpu)

The cuFile library has a metric for IO utilization per GPU by application. This metric indicates the amount of time, in percentage, that the cuFile resource was busy in IO.

To run a single-threaded `gdsio`

test, run the following command:

```
$./gdsio -f /mnt/md1/test -d 0 -n 0 -w 1 -s 10G -i 4K -x 0 -I 1
```

Here is the sample output:

```
PER_GPU STATS
GPU 0 Read: bw=0 util(%)=0 n=0 posix=0 unalign=0 err=0 mb=0 Write: bw=0.154598
util(%)=89 n=510588 posix=0 unalign=0 err=0 mb=1994 BufRegister: n=1 err=0 free=0 mb=0
```

The `util`

metric says that the application was completing IO on GPU 0 89% of the time.

To run a `gdsio`

test using two-threads, run the following command:

```
$./gdsio -f /mnt/md1/test -d 0 -n 0 -w 2 -s 10G -i 4K -x 0 -I 1
```

Here is the sample output:

```
PER_GPU STATS
GPU 0 Read: bw=0 util(%)=0 n=0 posix=0 unalign=0 err=0 mb=0 Write: bw=0.164967 util(%)=186 n=140854 posix=0 unalign=0 err=0 mb=550 BufRegister: n=2 err=0 free=0 mb=0
```

Now the utilization is ~186%, which indicates the amount of parallelism in the way each GPU is used for IO.

## 20.2. User-space Statistics for Dynamic Routing[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#user-space-statistics-for-dynamic-routing)

The `PER_GPU`

section of `gds_stats`

has a `dr`

counter which indicates how many `cuFileRead`

/ `cuFileWrite`

s for a GPU have been issued using dynamic routing.

```
$ ./gds_stats -p <pidof application> -l 3
GPU 0 Read: bw=0 util(%)=0 n=0 posix=0 unalign=0 dr=0 r_sparse=0 r_inline=0
err=0 MiB=0 Write: bw=3.37598 util(%)=532 n=6629 posix=0 unalign=0 dr=6629 err=0
MiB=6629 BufRegister: n=4 err=0 free=0 MiB=4
GPU 1 Read: bw=0 util(%)=0 n=0 posix=0 unalign=0 dr=0 r_sparse=0 r_inline=0
err=0 MiB=0 Write: bw=3.29297 util(%)=523 n=6637 posix=0 unalign=0 dr=6637 err=0
MiB=6637 BufRegister: n=4 err=0 free=0 MiB=4
```

# 21. User-Space RDMA Counters in GPUDirect Storage[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#user-space-rdma-counters-in-gpudirect-storage)

The library provides counters to monitor the RDMA traffic at a per-GPU level and requires that cuFile starts verbosity with a value of 3.

Table [cuFile RDMA IO Counters (PER_GPU RDMA STATS)](https://docs.nvidia.com#table-cufile-rdma-io-counters) provides the following information:

Each column stores the total number of bytes that are sent/received between a GPU and a NIC.

Each row shows the distribution of RDMA load with regards to a GPU across all NICS.

Each row reflects the order of affinity that a GPU has with a NIC.

Ideally, all traffic should be routed through the NIC with the best affinity or is closest to the GPU as shown in

[Example 1](https://docs.nvidia.com#table-cufile-rdma-io-counters-per-gpu-rdma-stats).

In the annotation of each NIC entry in the table, the major number is the pci-distance in terms of the number
of hops between the GPU and the NIC, and the minor number indicates the current bandwidth of the NIC (link_width
multiplied by pci-generation). The NICs that the GPUs use for RDMA are loaded from the `rdma_dev_addr_list cufile.json`

property:

```
"rdma_dev_addr_list": [
"172.172.1.240",
"172.172.1.241",
"172.172.1.242",
"172.172.1.243",
"172.172.1.244",
"172.172.1.245",
"172.172.1.246",
"172.172.1.247" ],
```

Each IP address corresponds to an IB device that appear as column entries in the RDMA counter table.

## 21.1. cuFile RDMA IO Counters (PER_GPU RDMA STATS)[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cufile-rdma-io-counters-per-gpu-rdma-stats)
