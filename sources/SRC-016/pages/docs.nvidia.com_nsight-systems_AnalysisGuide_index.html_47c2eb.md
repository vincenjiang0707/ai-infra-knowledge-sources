# Post-Collection Analysis Guide[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#post-collection-analysis-guide)

NVIDIA Nsight Systems Analysis guide.

## Overview[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#overview)

Once you have profiled using Nsight Systems there are many options for analyzing the collected data, as well as to output it in various formats. These options are available from the CLI or the GUI.

## Statistical Analysis[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#statistical-analysis)

### Statistical Reports Shipped With Nsight Systems[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#statistical-reports-shipped-with-product-name)

The Nsight Systems development team created and maintains a set of report scripts for some of the commonly requested statistical reports. These scripts will be updated to adapt to any changes in SQLite schema or internal data structures.

These scripts are located in the Nsight Systems package in the Target-<architecture>/reports directory. The following standard reports are available:

Note

The ability to display mangled names is a recent addition to the report file format, and requires that the profile data be captured with a recent version of Nsight Systems. Re-exporting an existing report file is not sufficient. If the raw, mangled kernel name data is not available, the default demangled names will be used.

Note

All time values given in nanoseconds by default. If you wish to output the results using a different time unit, use the `--timeunit`

option when running the recipe.

, and
`cuda_gpu_mem_size_sum`

reports. It is very similar to profile section of

#### cuda_gpu_kern_sum[:nvtx-name][:base|:mangled] – CUDA GPU Kernel Summary[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-gpu-kern-sum-nvtx-name-base-mangled-cuda-gpu-kernel-summary)

Note

In recent versions of Nsight Systems, this report was expanded to include and sort by CUDA grid and block dimensions. This change was made to accommodate developers doing a certain type of optimization work. Unfortunately, this change caused an unexpected burden for developers doing a different type of optimization work. In order to service both use-cases, this report has been returned to the original form, without grid or block information. A new report, called `cuda_gpu_kern_gb_sum`

, has been created that retains the grid and block information.

Output: All time values default to nanoseconds

PID : Process ID that made kernel launch call

TID : Thread ID that made kernel launch call

DevId : CUDA Device ID that executed kernel (which GPU)

Count : Number of kernel records

QCount : Number of kernel records with positive queue time


Average, Median, Minimum, Maximum, and Standard Deviation for:

QAvg, QMed, QMin, QMax, QStdDev : Queue time

KAvg, KMed, KMin, KMax, KStdDev : Kernel time

API Name : Name of CUDA API call used to launch kernel

Kernel Name : Name of CUDA Kernel


This report provides a summary of the launch and execution times of CUDA kernels. The launch and execution is broken down into three phases: “API time,” the execution time of the CUDA API call on the CPU used to launch the kernel; “Queue time,” the time between the launch call and the kernel execution; and “Kernel time,” the kernel execution time on the GPU. The “total time” is not a just sum of the other times, as the phases sometimes overlap. Rather, the total time runs from the start of the API call to end of the API call or the end of the kernel execution, whichever is later.

The reported queue time is measured from the end of the API call to the start of the kernel execution. The actual queue time is slightly longer, as the kernel is enqueue somewhere in the middle of the API call, and not in the final nanosecond of function execution. Due to this delay, it is possible for kernel execution to start before the CUDA launch call returns. In these cases, no queue time will be reported. Only kernel launches with positive queue times are included in the queue average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation calculations. The “QCount” column indicates how many launches had positive queue times (and how many launches were involved in calculating the queue time statistics). Subtracting “QCount” from “Count” will indicate how many kernels had no queue time.

Be aware that having a queue time is not inherently bad. Queue times indicate that the GPU was busy running other tasks when the new kernel was scheduled for launch. If every kernel launch is immediate, without any queue time, that _may_ indicate an idle GPU with poor utilization. In terms of performance optimization, it should not necessarily be a goal to eliminate queue time.

This report provides a trace of the launch and execution time of each CUDA kernel.

#### network_congestion[:ticks_threshold=<ticks_per_ms>] – Network Devices Congestion[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#network-congestion-ticks-threshold-ticks-per-ms-network-devices-congestion)

Arguments

ticks_threshold=<ticks_per_ms> - Threshold in ticks/ms above which we report congestion. Default is 10000.


Output: All time values default to nanoseconds

Start : Start timestamp of congestion interval

End : End timestamp of congestion interval

Duration : Duration of congestion interval

Send wait rate: Rate of congestion during the interval

GUID : The device GUID

Name : The device name


This report displays congestion events with a high send wait rate. By default, only events with a send wait rate above 10000 ticks/ms are shown, but a custom threshold value can be set.

Each event defines a period of time when the device experienced some level of congestion. The level of congestion is defined by the send wait rate, given in time ticks per millisecond (ticks/ms). The specific duration of a tick is device specific, but can be assumed to be nanoseconds in scale. Congestion is measured by counting the number of ticks during which the port had data to transmit, but no data was sent because of insufficient credits or because of lack of arbitration. The presented value of send wait rate is the amount of ticks counted during an event, normalized over the event’s duration. Higher send wait rate values indicate more congestion.

Because the specific duration of a tick is device dependent, analysis should focus on the relative send wait rates of events generated by the same device. Comparing absolute send wait rates across devices is only meaningful if the time tick duration is known to be similar.

For IB Switch metrics, we do not present the device name, only the GUID.

#### nvtx_gpu_proj_sum – NVTX GPU Projection Summary[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#nvtx-gpu-proj-sum-nvtx-gpu-projection-summary)

Proj StdDev : Standard deviation of projected times for this range

Total GPU Ops : Total number of GPU ops

Avg GPU Ops : Average number of GPU ops

Avg Range Lvl : Average range stack depth

Avg Num Child : Average number of children ranges


This report provides a summary of NVTX time ranges projected from the CPU to the GPU. Each NVTX range contains one or more GPU operations. A GPU operation is considered to be “contained” by the NVTX range if the CUDA API call used to launch the operation is within the NVTX range. Only ranges that start and end on the same thread are taken into account.

The projected range will have the start timestamp of the start of the first enclosed GPU operation and the end timestamp of the end of the last enclosed GPU operation. This report then summarizes all the range instances by name and style. Note that in cases when one NVTX range might enclose another, the time of the child(ren) range(s) is not subtracted from the parent range. This is because the projected times may not strictly overlap like the original NVTX range times do. As such, the total projected time of all ranges might exceed the total sampling duration.

#### nvtx_gpu_proj_trace – NVTX GPU Projection Trace[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#nvtx-gpu-proj-trace-nvtx-gpu-projection-trace)

This report provides a trace of NVTX time ranges projected from the CPU onto the GPU. Each NVTX range contains one or more GPU operations. A GPU operation is considered to be “contained” by an NVTX range if the CUDA API call used to launch the operation is within the NVTX range. Only ranges that start and end on the same thread are taken into account.

The projected range will have the start timestamp of the first enclosed GPU operation and the end timestamp of the last enclosed GPU operation, as well as the stack state and relationship to other NVTX ranges.

#### nvtx_kern_sum[:base|:mangled] – NVTX Range Kernel Summary[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#nvtx-kern-sum-base-mangled-nvtx-range-kernel-summary)

Arguments

base - Optional argument, if given, will cause summary to be over the base name of the CUDA kernel, rather than the templated name.

mangled - Optional argument, if given, will cause summary to be over the raw mangled name of the kernel, rather than the templated name.


Note

The ability to display mangled names is a recent addition to the report file format, and requires that the profile data be captured with a recent version of Nsight Systems. Re-exporting an existing report file is not sufficient. If the raw, mangled kernel name data is not available, the default demangled names will be used.

Output: All time values default to nanoseconds

NVTX Range : Name of the range

Style : Range style; Start/End or Push/Pop

PID : Process ID for this set of ranges and kernels

TID : Thread ID for this set of ranges and kernels

Kern Inst : Number of CUDA kernel instances

Total Time : Total time used by all kernel instances of this range

Avg : Average execution time of the kernel

Med : Median execution time of the kernel

Min : Smallest execution time of the kernel

Max : Largest execution time of the kernel

StdDev : Standard deviation of the execution time of the kernel

Kernel Name : Name of the kernel


This report provides a summary of CUDA kernels, grouped by NVTX ranges. To compute this summary, each kernel is matched to one or more containing NVTX range in the same process and thread ID. A kernel is considered to be “contained” by an NVTX range if the CUDA API call used to launch the kernel is within the NVTX range. The actual execution of the kernel may last longer than the NVTX range. A specific kernel instance may be associated with more than one NVTX range if the ranges overlap. For example, if a kernel is launched inside a stack of push/pop ranges, the kernel is considered to be “contained” by all of the ranges on the stack, not just the deepest range. This becomes very confusing if NVTX ranges appear inside other NVTX ranges of the same name.

Once each kernel is associated to one or more NVTX range(s), the list of ranges and kernels grouped by range name, kernel name, and PID/TID. A summary of the kernel instances and their execution times is then computed. The “NVTX Inst” column indicates how many NVTX range instances contained this kernel, while the “Kern Inst” column indicates the number of kernel instances in the summary line.

### Report Formatters Shipped With Nsight Systems[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#report-formatters-shipped-with-product-name)

The following formats are available in Nsight Systems

#### Column[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#column)

Usage:

```
column[:nohdr][:nolimit][:nofmt][:<width>[:<width>]...]
```

Arguments

`nohdr`

: Do not display the header.`nolimit`

: Remove 100 character limit from auto-width columns Note: This can result in extremely wide columns.`nofmt`

: Do not reformat numbers.`<width>...`

: Define the explicit width of one or more columns. If the value`.`

is given, the column will auto-adjust. If a width of 0 is given, the column will not be displayed.

The column formatter presents data in vertical text columns. It is primarily designed to be a human-readable format for displaying data on a console display.

Text data will be left-justified, while numeric data will be right-justified. If the data overflows the available column width, it will be marked with a “…” character, to indicate the data values were clipped. Clipping always occurs on the right-hand side, even for numeric data.

Numbers will be reformatted to make easier to visually scan and understand. This
includes adding thousands-separators. This process requires that the string
representation of the number is converted into its native representation
(integer or floating point) and then converted back into a string representation
to print. This conversion process attempts to preserve elements of number
presentation, such as the number of decimal places, or the use of scientific
notation, but the conversion is not always perfect (the number should always be
the same, but the presentation may not be). To disable the reformatting process,
use the argument `nofmt`

.

If no explicit width is given, the columns auto-adjust their width based off the header size and the first 100 lines of data. This auto-adjustment is limited to a maximum width of 100 characters. To allow larger auto-width columns, pass the initial argument nolimit. If the first 100 lines do not calculate the correct column width, it is suggested that explicit column widths be provided.

#### Table[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#table)

Usage:

```
table[:nohdr][:nolimit][:nofmt][:<width>[:<width>]...]
```

Arguments

`nohdr`

: Do not display the header.`nolimit`

: Remove 100 character limit from auto-width columns Note: This can result in extremely wide columns.`nofmt`

: Do not reformat numbers.`<width>...`

: Define the explicit width of one or more columns. If the value`.`

is given, the column will auto-adjust. If a width of 0 is given, the column will not be displayed.

The table formatter presents data in vertical text columns inside text boxes. Other than the lines between columns, it is identical to the column formatter.

#### CSV[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#csv)

Usage:

```
csv[:nohdr]
```

Arguments

`nohdr`

: Do not display the header.

The csv formatter outputs data as comma-separated values. This format is commonly used for import into other data applications, such as spread-sheets and databases.

There are many different standards for CSV files. Most differences are in how escapes are handled, meaning data values that contain a comma or space.

This CSV formatter will escape commas by surrounding the whole value in double-quotes.

#### TSV[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#tsv)

Usage:

```
tsv[:nohdr][:esc]
```

Arguments

`nohdr`

: Do not display the header.`esc`

: escape tab characters, rather than removing them.

The TSV formatter outputs data as tab-separated values. This format is sometimes used for import into other data applications, such as spreadsheets and databases.

Most TSV import/export systems disallow the tab character in data values. The formatter will normally replace any tab characters with a single space. If the esc argument has been provided, any tab characters will be replaced with the literal characters “t”.

#### JSON[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#json)

Usage:

```
json
```

Arguments: no arguments

The JSON formatter outputs data as an array of JSON objects. Each object represents one line of data, and uses the column names as field labels. All objects have the same fields. The formatter attempts to recognize numeric values, as well as JSON keywords, and converts them. Empty values are passed as an empty string (and not nil, or as a missing field).

At this time the formatter does not escape quotes, so if a data value includes double-quotation marks, it will corrupt the JSON file.

#### HDoc[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#hdoc)

```
hdoc[:title=<title>][:css=<URL>]
```

Arguments:

`title`

: string for HTML document title.`css`

: URL of CSS document to include.

The HDoc formatter generates a complete, verifiable (mostly), standalone HTML
document. It is designed to be opened in a web browser, or included in a larger
document via an `<iframe>`

.

#### HTable[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#htable)

Usage:

```
htable
```

Arguments: no arguments

The HTable formatter outputs a raw HTML `<table>`

without any of the surrounding
HTML document. It is designed to be included into a larger HTML document.
Although most web browsers will open and display the document, it is better to
use the HDoc format for this type of use.

## Expert Systems Analysis[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#expert-systems-analysis)

The Nsight Systems expert system is a feature aimed at automatic detection of performance optimization opportunities in an application’s profile. It uses a set of predefined rules to determine if the application has known bad patterns.

### Using Expert System from the CLI[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-expert-system-from-the-cli)

usage:

```
nsys [global-options] analyze [options]
[nsys-rep-or-sqlite-file]
```

If a .nsys-rep file is given as the input file and there is no .sqlite file with the same name in the same directory, it will be generated.

Note

The Expert System view in the GUI will give you the equivalent command line.

### Using Expert System from the GUI[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-expert-system-from-the-gui)

The Expert System View can be found in the same drop-down as the Events View. If there is no .sqlite file with the same name as the .nsys-rep file in the same directory, it will be generated.

The Expert System View has the following components:

Drop-down to select the rule to be run.

Rule description and advice summary.

CLI command that will give the same result.

Table containing results of running the rule.

Settings button that allows users to specify the rule’s arguments.


A context menu is available to correlate the table entry with the timeline. The options are the same as the Events View:

Zoom to Selected on Timeline (ctrl+double-click)


The highlighting is not supported for rules that do not return an event but rather an arbitrary time range (e.g., GPU utilization rules).

The CLI and GUI share the same rule scripts and messages. There might be some formatting differences between the output table in GUI and CLI.

### Expert System Rules[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#expert-system-rules)

Rules are scripts that run on the SQLite DB output from Nsight Systems to find common improvable usage patterns.

Each rule has an advice summary with explanation of the problem found and suggestions to address it. Only the top 50 results are displayed by default.

There are currently six rules in the expert system. They are described below. Additional rules will be made available in a future version of Nsight Systems.

#### CUDA Synchronous Operation Rules[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-synchronous-operation-rules)

**Asynchronous memcpy with pageable memory**

This rule identifies asynchronous memory transfers that end up becoming synchronous if the memory is pageable. This rule is not applicable for Nsight Systems Embedded Platforms Edition

Suggestion: If applicable, use pinned memory instead

**Synchronous Memcpy**

This rule identifies synchronous memory transfers that block the host.

Suggestion: Use cudaMemcpy*Async APIs instead.

**Synchronous Memset**

This rule identifies synchronous memset operations that block the host.

Suggestion: Use cudaMemset*Async APIs instead.

**Synchronization APIs**

This rule identifies synchronization APIs that block the host until all issued CUDA calls are complete.

Suggestions: Avoid excessive use of synchronization. Use asynchronous CUDA event calls, such as cudaStreamWaitEvent and cudaEventSynchronize, to prevent host synchronization.

#### GPU Low Utilization Rules[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gpu-low-utilization-rules)

Nsight Systems determines GPU utilization based on API trace data in the collection. Current rules consider CUDA, Vulkan, DX12, and OpenGL API use of the GPU.

**GPU Starvation**

This rule identifies time ranges where a GPU is idle for longer than 500ms. The threshold is adjustable.

Suggestions: Use CPU sampling data, OS Runtime blocked state backtraces, and/or OS Runtime APIs related to thread synchronization to understand if a sluggish or blocked CPU is causing the gaps. Add NVTX annotations to CPU code to understand the reason behind the gaps.

Notes: For each process, each GPU is examined, and gaps are found within the time range that starts with the beginning of the first GPU operation on that device and ends with the end of the last GPU operation on that device. GPU gaps that cannot be addressed by the user are excluded. This includes:

Profiling overhead in the middle of a GPU gap.

The initial gap in the report that is seen before the first GPU operation.

The final gap that is seen after the last GPU operation.


**GPU Low Utilization**

This rule identifies time regions with low utilization.

Suggestions: Use CPU sampling data, OS Runtime blocked state backtraces, and/or OS Runtime APIs related to thread synchronization to understand if a sluggish or blocked CPU is causing the gaps. Add NVTX annotations to CPU code to understand the reason behind the gaps.

Notes: For each process, each GPU is examined, and gaps are found within the time range that starts with the beginning of the first GPU operation on that device and ends with the end of the last GPU operation on that device. This time range is then divided into equal chunks, and the GPU utilization is calculated for each chunk. The utilization includes all GPU operations as well as profiling overheads that the user cannot address.

The utilization refers to the “time” utilization and not the “resource” utilization. This rule attempts to find time gaps when the GPU is or isn’t being used, but does not take into account how many GPU resources are being used. Therefore, a single running memcpy is considered the same amount of “utilization” as a huge kernel that takes over all the cores. If multiple operations run concurrently in the same chunk, their utilization will be added up and may exceed 100%.

Chunks with an in-use percentage less than the threshold value are displayed. If consecutive chunks have a low in-use percentage, the individual chunks are coalesced into a single display record, keeping the weighted average of percentages. This is why returned chunks may have different durations.

## AI-Assisted Analysis[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#ai-assisted-analysis)

Note

AI-Assisted Analysis is a **Preview Feature**.

Nsight Systems ships with an AI skill that helps users use the CLI, run post-collection analysis recipes and analyze the collected profiling data. This skill is packed in a “bring your own” (BYO) pack that can be used with different AI agents. The skill pack works in a progressive discoverability mode, where SKILL.md is the starting point, which guides the agent to navigate the skill pack’s vast knowledge base for Nsight Systems-related concepts, and directs the agent to follow a structured path for post-collection analysis. The workflow directs the agent to run skill pack’s scripts to retrieve insights from the collected profiling data and to ground its answers in the product documentation.

### Directing an AI Agent to Use the Skill Pack[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#directing-an-ai-agent-to-use-the-skill-pack)

Point your agent at the skill file,
`<nsys-install-folder>/skills/nsight-systems/SKILL.md`

, in one of two ways:

**Persistent hook**— add a line to your agent’s context root file (`CLAUDE.md`

,`AGENTS.md`

, or equivalent):To use nsys refer to '<nsys-install-folder>/skills/nsight-systems/SKILL.md'

**Single prompt**— reference the skill file in one request:Profile the CUDA kernels in ~/work/my_app with nsys as detailed in <nsys-install-folder>/skills/nsight-systems/SKILL.md


Both `nsys --help`

and the Nsight Systems GUI report window print the resolved
path to let users easily copy the exact path of the SKILL.md file.

### What the Skill Pack Covers[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#what-the-skill-pack-covers)

The pack helps with Nsight Systems product, CLI, recipe, and report-analysis questions. Its knowledge spans across different Nsight Systems profiling activities, including CPU and GPU work, CUDA API and kernel behavior, graphics APIs and frame and stutter analysis, OS runtime, NVTX, MPI, and NCCL activity.

Disclaimer

Agentic AI is inherently non-deterministic: the same prompt can produce different results across runs, and outputs may be incomplete or inaccurate. Additionally, this skill is tested against a limited set of AI models, and results may vary between them and across versions. Treat results as drafts, and verify important findings against the Nsight Systems documentation, live CLI or recipe help, and the profiling report data before relying on them.

## Advanced Report Analysis[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#advanced-report-analysis)

Nsight Systems Advanced Report Analysis is functionality to better support complex statistical analysis across multiple result files. Possible use cases for this functionality include:

Multi-Node Analysis - When you run Nsight Systems across a cluster, it typically generates one result file per rank on the cluster. While you can load multiple result files into the GUI for visualization, this analysis system allows you to run statistical analysis across all of the result files.

Multi-Pass Analysis - Some features in Nsight Systems cannot be run together due to overhead or hardware considerations. For example, there are frequently more CPU performance counters available than your CPU has registers. Using this analysis, you could run multiple runs with different sets of counters and then analyze the results together.

Multi-Run Analysis - Sometimes you want to compare two runs that were not taken at the same time together. Perhaps you ran the tool on two different hardware configurations and want to see what changed. Perhaps you are doing regression testing or performance improvement analysis and want to check your status. Comparing those result files statistically can show patterns.

Complex/multi-phase analysis - Sometimes you may want to perform a complicated, or multi-phase analysis on one or more results files. The helper functionality available in the Advanced Analysis system can simplify common steps.

Complex data output - Sometimes you want to be able to build complex visualizations from your analysis, rather than just tabular data from bare statistics.


**Analysis Steps**

Note

Prior to using advanced analysis, please make sure that you have
installed all required dependencies. See **Installing Advanced Analysis
System** in the **Installation Guide** for more information.

Generate the reports - Generate the reports as you always have, in fact, you can use reports that you have generated previously.

Set up - Choose the recipe (See Available Recipes, below), give it any required parameters, and run.

Launch Analysis - Nsight Systems will run the analysis, using your local system or Dask, as you have selected.

Output - the output is a directory containing an .nsys-analysis file, which can then be opened within the Nsight Systems GUI.

View the data - depending on your recipe, you can have any number of visualizations, from simple tabular information to Jupyter notebooks which can be opened inside the GUI.


### Available Advanced Analysis Recipes[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#available-advanced-analysis-recipes)

All advanced analysis recipes are run using the `recipe`

CLI command switch.

usage:

```
nsys recipe [args] <recipe-name> [recipe args]
```

Nsight Systems provides several initial analysis recipes, mostly based around making our existing statistics and expert systems rules run multi-report.

These recipes can be found at
`<install-dir>/target-<os>-<arch>/python/packages/nsys_recipe/recipes`

.
Please note that all recipes are in the form of python scripts. You may alter
the given recipes or write your own to meet your needs. Refer to

### Recipe Output Examples[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#recipe-output-examples)

A successful recipe run outputs a directory containing different files. This section gives some common examples of these output types.

**Table**

Trace or summary data will be stored in data storage formats such as CSV, Parquet, or Arrow. Typically, you can also access the same data within the output Jupyter notebook.

Summary table:


Trace table:


Overlap table:


**Visualization**

Some recipes include data visualization in the output Jupyter notebooks. These graphs use Plotly, which provides interactivity.

### Opening in Jupyter Notebook[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#opening-in-jupyter-notebook)

Running the recipe command creates a new analysis file (.nsys-analysis). Open the Nsight Systems GUI and select `File->Open`

, and pick your file.

Open the folder icon and click on the notebook icon to open the Jupyter notebook.

Run the Jupyter notebook:

And the output appears on-screen. In this case a heat map of activity running a Jacobi solver.

### Configuring Dask[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#configuring-dask)

The multi-report analysis system does not offer options to configure the Dask environment. However, you could achieve this by modifying the recipe script directly or using one of the following from Dask’s configuration system:

YAML files: By default, Dask searches for all YAML files in

`~/.config/dask/`

or`/etc/dask/`

. This search path can be changed using the environment variable`DASK_ROOT_CONFIG`

or`DASK_CONFIG`

. See the[Dask documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/)for the complete list of locations and the lookup order. Example:$ cat example.yaml 'Distributed': 'scheduler': 'allowed-failures': 5

Environment variables: Dask searches for all environment variables that start with

`DASK_`

, then transforms keys by converting to lower-case and changing double-underscores to nested structures. See Dask documentation for the complete list of variables. Example:DASK_DISTRIBUTED__SCHEDULER__ALLOWED_FAILURES=5


**Dask Client**

With no configuration set, the dask-futures mode option initializes the Dask Client with the default arguments, which results in creating a LocalCluster in the background. The following are the YAML/environment variables that could be set to change the default behavior:

distributed.comm.timeouts.connect / DASK_DISTRIBUTED__COMM__TIMEOUTS__CONNECT

client-name / DASK_CLIENT_NAME

scheduler-address / DASK_SCHEDULER_ADDRESS

distributed.client.heartbeat / DASK_DISTRIBUTED__CLIENT__HEARTBEAT

distributed.client.scheduler-info-interval / DASK_DISTRIBUTED__CLIENT__SCHEDULER_INFO_INTERVAL

distributed.client.preload / DASK_DISTRIBUTED__CLIENT__PRELOAD

distributed.client.preload-argv / DASK_DISTRIBUTED__CLIENT__PRELOAD_ARGV


**Recipe’s environment variables**

Recipe has its own list of environment variables to make the configuration more complete and flexible. These environment variables are either missing from Dask’s configuration system or specific to the recipe system:

NSYS_DASK_SCHEDULER_FILE: Path to a file with scheduler information. It will be used to initialize the Dask Client.

NSYS_DIR: Path to the directory of Nsight Systems containing the target and host directories. The nsys executable and the recipe dependencies will be searched in this directory instead of the one deduced from the currently running recipe file path.


### gfx_hotspot Recipe[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gfx-hotspot-recipe)

This recipe’s output is different from other recipes and is presented as a web application.

The output can be viewed by passing the `--run-viewer`

argument to the recipe -
along with the further `--show-viewer`

which will automatically open a web
browser to the report view.

Alternatively, a previously-executed `gfx_hotspot`

recipe’s output can be
viewed by executing the `run_viewer.py`

script from the recipe output folder.

For the best results, run the recipe on a report with resolved symbols.

**Threading Analysis**

In this tab, an overview of the multi-threading behavior of the target (most active) process is presented.

- Application Statistics:
This table shows the CPU and thread statistics for the target process.


- CPU Info:
This table shows information about the CPU hardware.


- Top 5 Processes CPU Utilisation:
This table shows the most active processes during the sample, to help detect situations where another process is interfering with the target process’s execution.


- Threading Health Check:
This table contains a list of very common CPU-bound application performance indicators. If the target application is GPU bound, the entire table will be shown in green. If it is CPU bound, then each row will be highlighted in green if the value is healthy, in yellow if it requires attention, and in red if it potentially indicates of a threading issue. For unhealthy metrics, the “warning” column will also show steps or investigation angles that may be considered in order to improve the result.


- Thread Utilisation:
This graph shows the process threads, ordered from most busy to least.


- Thread Concurrency:
This graph shows the percentage and amount of time an average graphic frame is running each number of threads concurrently. High percentage of low thread counts could indicate excessive serialization in the algorithm, where CPU work could be better parallelized by improving the use of multi-threading.



**Hotspot Analysis**

- In this tab, frames are selected in one of four methods:
Longest Frame time (Slow Frames)

Periodic time-based selection (Periodic Frames)

Frames with highest transfer activity (Bar1 Reads)

Frames with least GPU activity (GR Idle)



The report view then allows comparing the selected frames to each other and to the median frame in the same metric, helping identify the main differences and possible problem areas in each one.

- Overview:
These tables show the report overview as well as the frame selection method and other capture-wide statistics and general information. A shorthand list of the “Performance Issues” table for each frame is also shown.


- Frame Times:
This graph shows a sequence of the graphical frames (CPU time and GPU time derived from GPU Utilisation percentage per CPU frame time) ordered by their index. The selected frames are indicated and labelled. Clicking any of the indicated frames will set it as the left frame for comparison.


- Region / Compare to:
These controls allow selecting the two frames to be shown for comparison. “Periodic Frames” shows 10 sampled frames (with equally distributed indices), while the other three modes show the 5 frames with the highest value in the chosen metric and the median frame in the same metric. All information from this point onwards is shown per selected frame in each of the two columns, allowing for 1-to-1 comparison. Selecting the same frame for both controls will show just the single frame as the entire width of the view.


- Frame Info:
This table shows the frame duration and start time, the number of threads that were active during the frame, and the thread IDs of key threads in the frame processing operation which are important for determining likely performance issues.


- Performance Issues:
This table shows the key performance limiters and hotspots for the selected frame. Each indicator will have a breakdown of what indicators were present to call out the performance issue during this frame. These indicators are not necessarily the root cause of the problems in the region, but have been flagged for consideration.


- GPU Metrics:
This table shows the average or total (respectively) values of the GPU metrics collected during the frame time. If GPU Metrics were not collected, this table will not appear.


- System ETW Events (Windows only):
This chart shows a breakdown of the system process-reported ETW events during the frame. If WDDM trace and Custom ETW trace were not collected, this chart will not appear.


- DxgKrnl Events (Windows only):
This chart shows a breakdown of the DxgKrnl ETW provider events during the frame. If WDDM trace was not collected, this chart will not appear.


- CPU Thread Utilisation Time:
This graph shows the time spent inside each thread during the frame. The bars match the two selected frames, and the matching-colored line shows the total frame time. Clicking any of the columns in the graph will select that thread for the following elements in the report.


- Thread:
This control allows selecting the thread to be shown in the following views.


- Call stacks:
This control shows the sampled call stacks during the frame. Clicking a call stack frame will filter the view to only show call stacks containing this call stack frame, allowing to drill down into potential problem areas. The title of the control indicates the two modes selected for display, which can be switched with the two toggles in the top right of the control:


- Call stacks - Merged:
Merges all similar call stacks logically, regardless of when in the frame time the functions appeared. This is useful to see where the cumulative time is spent.


- Call stacks - Over Time:
Keeps call stacks ordered chronologically, so that repeated calls to the same function appear separately.


- Periodic Sampled Call stacks:
Only shows call stacks acquired by periodic sampling (matching the orange marks in Nsight Systems’s timeline view). This view provides a better statistical overview of where the frame time was spent.


- All Call stacks:
Shows periodic sampled call stacks as well as call stacks acquired from other sources such as call stacks from ETW events (Windows) and event-based sampling (Linux) (matching both the orange AND the grey marks in Nsight Systems’s timeline view).


- Modules in Sampled Call Stacks:
This graph shows the number of call stacks in the frame that include at least one call stack frame in a function belonging to each module. This helps identify which modules were the most active during the frame.


- ETW Events (Windows only):
This chart shows a breakdown of the thread-reported ETW events during the frame. If WDDM trace and Custom ETW trace were not collected, this chart will not appear.


- Context Switch Call Stacks:
This table shows a breakdown of the call stacks that led to context switches for the thread during the frame, indicating where the thread may have stalled. Hovering the mouse cursor over the “Name” column will show the full call stack for each entry.


- DX12 API / Vulkan API:
These tables show a breakdown of the graphical API functions that appeared in sampled call stacks. If DX12 / Vulkan trace were not collected, these tables will not appear.


- Known Symbols From Sampled Call Stacks:
This table shows a breakdown of known symbols that often cause performance issues, such as DX12’s CreateCommittedResource. If symbols were not resolved for the nsys-rep file, this table will not appear.


- PIX Markers (Windows only):
This table shows a breakdown of PIX marker ranges that contained sampled call stacks. If WDDM trace and DX11 / DX12 trace were not collected or the target application does not use PIX markers, this table will not appear.



### gpu_vram_usage_trace Recipe - Preview Feature[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gpu-vram-usage-trace-recipe-preview-feature)

This recipe analyzes VRAM usage patterns and statistics from Nsight Systems reports, helping identify and troubleshoot potential issues in GPU memory management.

**Overview**

The gpu_vram_usage_trace recipe generates an interactive Jupyter notebook that analyzes VRAM usage patterns, such as resource migrations between VRAM and system memory, and resource allocation and deallocation timing. This analysis helps identify memory management issues, optimization opportunities, and potential causes of performance degradation related to GPU memory usage.

**Key Capabilities**

The recipe provides insights into:

**VRAM Usage Tracking**: Per-frame monitoring of VRAM’s and SYSMEM’s usage, commitment, and budget across all GPU resources.**Memory Resource Details**: Comprehensive information for all allocated GPU memory resources.**Resource Migrations**: Analysis of resource migration patterns between VRAM and system memory.**Frame-by-Frame Analysis & Comparison**: Detailed view of available resources at a specific point in time and comparison to another.**Debugging Context Integration**: Correlation of memory resource usage with user-provided performance markers, resource debug names, and callstack information.

**Use Cases**

The recipe is particularly valuable for identifying and addressing the following scenarios (but not limited to these):

**VRAM Exhaustion**: Detecting when applications approach or exceed available VRAM limits, and identifying which resources are consuming the available VRAM.**Memory Thrashing**: Identifying excessive resource migrations between VRAM and system memory.**Frame Spikes**: Analyzing frames with abnormal performance due to VRAM usage and/or resource transitions.

**Important Notes**

**Preview Feature**: This recipe is a preview feature and may be subject to change in the near future.**Single Report Only**: This recipe is intended for use with a single report. Using it with multiple reports may cause unexpected behavior.

**Prerequisites**

**Windows (DirectX 12 and Vulkan)**: This recipe currently supports reports recorded on Windows, using either DirectX 12 or Vulkan.

**Usage**

This recipe requires that Nsight Systems reports be collected with WDDM tracing enabled.

Steps:

**Collect an nsys-rep report with WDDM tracing enabled****With `nsys.exe` (CLI)**: Use the parameters –trace=wddm together with either –wddm-memory-trace=true or –wddm-additional-events=true.**With `nsys-ui.exe` (GUI)**: Enable the**WDDM Trace**collector, using either the “Collect WDDM memory trace” or “Extensive trace including Hardware Scheduling queues…” option.

Note

*Optional: To collect additional debug name information on resources (affects the Resident Resources Details section), enable tracing of debug markers as follows:***For DirectX 12:**With

**`nsys-ui.exe` (GUI)**: Enable the**DX12 Trace**collector and the**Trace Debug Markers**option.With

**`nsys.exe` (CLI)**: Adjust the trace argument:`--trace=wddm,dx12-annotations`

.

**For Vulkan:**With

**`nsys-ui.exe` (GUI)**: Enable the**Vulkan Trace**collector and the**Trace Debug Markers**option.With

**`nsys.exe` (CLI)**: Adjust the trace argument:`--trace=wddm,vulkan-annotations`

.


**Run the recipe**`nsys recipe gpu_vram_usage_trace --input [report file path]`

**Open the generated notebook**Open the produced stats.ipynb Jupyter notebook to view the interactive analysis.

**Output**

As the main output, the recipe generates an interactive Jupyter notebook
`stats.ipynb`

with the following sections:

- Global Process and GPU Selectors:

- Interactive Timeline Charts:

- Resident Resources Diff Tables:

- Resident Resources Details Section:

- All Allocations Table:


**Recommended Workflow**

Start by selecting the process and GPU of interest using the global selectors at the top.

Identify and select suspicious frames, such as frames with unusual memory usage or with a high volume of memory transition events.

- Use the Resident Resources table to learn more about allocated resources during the selected frames:
Identify resources with significant memory usage.

Identify resources that have changed between the two points in time (transitioned between VRAM and SYSMEM, or were allocated/deallocated).

View resources’ allocation details, performance markers, and callstacks to help recognize the specific resources and possible problematic settings.



Use the “All Allocations” table to find suspicious resources, such as resources with excessive residency changes or other unusual characteristics.


### nvtx_cpu_topdown Recipe[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#nvtx-cpu-topdown-recipe)

This recipe calculates CPU Topdown methodology metrics for NVTX push/pop ranges based on collected PMU core events for NVIDIA CPUs featuring Arm cores. It can process multiple Nsight Systems reports.

Currently, the recipe supports NVIDIA Grace (TM) CPUs and NVIDIA DGX Spark (TM) CPUs.

We recommend using this recipe after running the `collect_cpu_topdown.sh`

script, which simplifies collecting all PMU core event and metric data needed to
perform a CPU Topdown analysis of the workload’s CPU performance. For more
details on this script, refer to the [Arm Topdown Analysis](https://docs.nvidia.com/UserGuide/index.html#arm-topdown-analysis) section.

If PMU core events other than those required by Topdown are collected, the recipe will calculate available CPU metrics based on them and display those metrics in the output.

**Use Case**

The recipe is most useful when the following conditions are met:

The application runs on CPU cores supported by the recipe.

The application is instrumented with NVTX push/pop ranges.

NVTX range spans a specific CPU algorithm / code section that does not make syscalls or calls to other libraries whose functions take significant time to execute.

NVTX ranges with the same name are used to represent the same workload across all threads and all repetitions.

The duration of the NVTX range is 5 ms or longer to obtain more accurate results.

In systems with heterogeneous CPU cores, the NVTX range executed on a given core type remains consistent across runs, ensuring a reliable view of CPU metrics for that range on that core type. For example, to achieve stable runs, you can pin the process to specific CPU cores using

`taskset`

.

Note

For the case of NVTX ranges from multiple threads, only the NVTX ranges from
either the main thread (default) or the thread specified via `--thread-name`

will be processed.

**Usage**

```
[1] mkdir reports && cd reports
[2] <path to target-linux-sbsa-armv8>/CpuProfiling/collect_cpu_topdown.sh ./myApp
[3] nsys recipe nvtx_cpu_topdown --input .
```

This step creates a new directory to store the reports. We recommend using an empty new directory, because the

`collect_cpu_topdown.sh`

script overwrites the output files and does not currently allow customization of file names.This step creates several report files: cpu-td1.nsys-rep, cpu-branch-ipc.nsys-rep, etc.

Note

Note that since multiple reports are created, this step can take significant time to complete.

This step runs the recipe, uses all reports in the current directory as the input, and produces a

`.ipynb`

Jupyter notebook,`.parquet`

and`.csv`

(if`--csv`

is specified) files as the output.

**Output**

As the main output, the recipe generates the Jupyter notebook
`nvtx_cpu_topdown.ipynb`

with the following sections:

- NVTX Summary for Heterogeneous CPU Cores:
Displays a summary of NVTX ranges compiled from Nsight Systems reports provided to the recipe.

For a report selected from the drop-down menu, the section shows each NVTX range (in call stack order) with its instance count, median* instance duration, and CPU time aggregated across heterogeneous cores, as well as CPU time per core type - both related to the NVTX instance with the median* duration.

Note: median* is defined as the middle value in the sorted list. For an even number of elements, it is the second of the two middle values.

Note

This section is available only for data collected from heterogeneous CPU cores. For these cores, the remaining sections apply to each CPU core type individually and can be toggled using the

`Select CPU Core`

drop-down menu.

- Warnings:
Displays warnings generated during recipe execution and related to the entire recipe output (or to the portion of it specific to a given CPU core type). If there are no warnings, this section is not displayed.


- NVTX Summary:
Displays a summary of NVTX ranges compiled from Nsight Systems reports provided to the recipe.

For a report selected from the drop-down menu, the section shows each NVTX range (in call stack order) with its instance count, median duration with median absolute deviation, median CPU time with median absolute deviation, and relevant notes.

If NVTX ranges are filtered out, they are grayed out in the table, and a note is displayed in the Notes column for the corresponding range. The following ranges are candidates to be filtered out:

Ranges that contain fewer than 3 PMU samples in at least one Nsight Systems report provided to the recipe.

Ranges that are not present in at least one Nsight Systems report provided to the recipe.


If NVTX ranges are not stable across some of the reports, the section will display a warning next to the unstable data and a note in the Notes column for the corresponding range.


- CPU Topdown Methodology Metrics:
Presents the metric results of the CPU Topdown methodology for the selected NVTX range.

For the range name selected from the drop-down menu, the most appropriate NVTX range instance is identified from the Nsight Systems reports as follows:

**For data collected from heterogeneous CPU cores:**The NVTX range instance with the median* CPU time is selected from each report.**Otherwise:**The NVTX range instance with the median* duration is selected from the first report (displayed by default in the NVTX Summary section). The corresponding instance index is then used to extract data from subsequent reports.Note: median* is defined as the middle value in a sorted list. For an even number of elements, it is the second of the two middle values.

The section shows the following tables:

Topdown Level 1 metrics

Frontend Bound metrics

Backend Bound metrics

Bad Speculation metrics

Retiring metrics

Miscellaneous metrics


Each table is displayed only when the required data is available.


- Report Summary:
Displays information about the Nsight Systems report files given to the recipe for input, as well as: the PMU core events collected in each specific report, and the CPU core metrics computed for each specific report.



### file_access_sum Recipe[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#file-access-sum-recipe)

This recipe analyzes file access patterns and I/O performance statistics from one or more Nsight Systems reports, aggregating data across processes and machines.

**Overview**

The file_access_sum recipe generates an interactive Jupyter notebook that analyzes POSIX VFS (Virtual File System) function calls captured during profiling sessions. This analysis helps identify I/O bottlenecks, optimization opportunities, and file access patterns that could impact application performance.

### s3_access_sum Recipe[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#s3-access-sum-recipe)

This recipe analyzes S3 access patterns and I/O statistics from one or more Nsight Systems’ reports, aggregating data across processes and hosts.

**Overview**

The s3_access_sum recipe generates an interactive Jupyter notebook that analyzes S3 operations captured during profiling sessions. It provides a statistical overview of which buckets and objects were accessed and of access patterns.

**Key Capabilities**

The recipe provides insights into:

**Bucket-Level Summary**: Aggregated access statistics per S3 bucket, including object counts, download/upload bytes, and operation counts.**Object Access Patterns**: Breakdown of download-only, upload-only, and mixed-access objects.**Hotspot Identification**: Top objects by download/upload volume and operation frequency.**Cross-Process Analysis**: S3 access patterns across multiple hosts, processes, and threads.**NVTX Range Correlation**: S3 activity correlated with user-defined NVTX ranges, such as access-time statistics and I/O volume.

**Use Cases**

The recipe is particularly valuable for identifying and addressing the following scenarios (but not limited to these):

**Hot Buckets and Objects**: Identifying which S3 buckets and objects carry the most traffic to focus optimization efforts.**Small or Frequent Operations**: Detecting frequent small S3 transfers that could benefit from batching or prefetching.**Application Phase Correlation**: Using NVTX ranges to understand which application phases drive the most S3 I/O.**Multi-Rank Comparison**: Comparing S3 usage across MPI ranks or hosts to identify load imbalances.

**Supported S3 Client Libraries**

The recipe counts the following operations from traced S3 client libraries:

**AWS CRT**(aws-c-s3):`GetObject`

,`PutObject`

,`CopyObject`

For more information about S3 tracing capabilities and setup, refer to [S3 Trace](https://docs.nvidia.com/UserGuide/index.html#s3-trace) in the User Guide.

**Prerequisites**

This recipe requires that Nsight Systems reports be collected with specific tracing parameters:

`--trace=s3`

- Enables S3 operation tracing.This recipe will also work with

`--trace=s3-verbose`

, but does not use any additional data from it.


**Optional:**To enable tracing of MPI rank information, use`--trace=mpi`

along with either`--mpi-impl=openmpi`

or`--mpi-impl=mpich`

.**Optional:**To enable the NVTX range correlation table, instrument your application code with NVTX ranges. See[Marking and Labeling Regions](https://docs.nvidia.com/UserGuide/index.html#marking-and-labeling-regions)in the User Guide.

**Usage**

```
[1] Create a reports folder.
[2] Collect nsys-rep reports, using '--trace=s3' parameter, and save them to the reports folder.
[3] Run the recipe, using 'nsys recipe s3_access_sum --input [reports folder path]'.
```

**Output**

As the main output, the recipe generates an interactive Jupyter notebook
`s3_access_stats.ipynb`

with the following sections:

- Bucket Access Summary:

- Objects Access Summary:

- Hottest Downloaded Objects:

- All Objects Table:

- S3 Access Statistics for NVTX Ranges:

### Recipe Composite Tables[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#recipe-composite-tables)

When writing a recipe, you use `CompositeTable`

enum values to request
pre-processed DataFrames. These composite tables join, rename, and resolve
raw parquet export tables into analysis-ready DataFrames, so you don’t
have to do the merging and ID-to-string resolution yourself.

#### Available Composite Tables[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#available-composite-tables)

CompositeTable |
Description |
|---|---|
|
All GPU activities (kernels, memcpy, memset, mem_decompress) concatenated into one table. Columns are the union of the raw CUPTI activity columns. Use this when you want a broad view of everything the GPU did. |
|
Same as |
|
GPU activities + CPU runtime API calls, correlated by |
|
Runtime + kernels only (no memcpy/memset). Like |
|
Kernels only with |
|
NVTX ranges with |
|
NCCL communication operations parsed from NVTX events. Includes
|
|
NCCL API-level view showing call durations, parsed from NVTX events. |
|
NCCL GPU-level operations view parsed from NVTX events. Includes collective and P2P operations with common payload fields and normalized operation identity columns. |
|
NCCL collective GPU operation view with collective-specific payload
fields such as |
|
Network interface metrics joined with device info. Columns include
|
|
InfiniBand switch port metrics with |
|
All MPI event tables (P2P, collectives, start/wait, other) concatenated
and sorted by start time. |
|
All UCX event tables (submit, progress, general) concatenated and sorted
by start time. |
|
GPU hardware metrics pivoted so each metric name becomes its own column
(e.g., |
|
CPU performance counter events enriched with |
|
Generic metric events with type and field IDs resolved to
|

#### Choosing the Right CUDA Table[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#choosing-the-right-cuda-table)

The CUDA-related composite tables can be confusing since there are five of them. Here is when to use each one:

Table |
Includes kernels |
Includes memcpy/memset |
Includes runtime API |
When to use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|
Yes |
Yes |
No |
Overview of all GPU activity |
|
Yes |
Yes |
No |
Same, but with CUDA graph correlation |
|
Yes |
No |
No |
Kernel-only analysis with resolved names |
|
Yes |
Yes |
Yes |
Full CPU-to-GPU pipeline analysis |
|
Yes |
No |
Yes |
Kernel launch overhead analysis with resolved names |

#### Output Columns[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#output-columns)

Each composite table produces a DataFrame with specific columns. The columns
depend on which raw tables were joined and what transformations were applied.
Also note: when tables are loaded through `DataService`

, bit-field
decomposition may add derived columns such as `pid`

, `tid`

, and `gpuId`

.

**CUDA_GPU**

```
correlationId start end globalPid deviceId contextId greenContextId streamId pid
```

**CUDA_GPU_GRAPH**

```
correlationId start end globalPid deviceId contextId greenContextId streamId graphNodeId graphId pid
```

`graphNodeId`

appears on kernel/memcpy/memset rows, and `graphId`

appears on
graph-trace rows.

**CUDA_KERNEL**

```
correlationId globalPid start end deviceId shortName mangledName demangledName pid
```

The `*Name`

columns contain resolved strings (not integer IDs).

**CUDA_COMBINED**

```
start end globalTid name correlationId gpu_start gpu_end pid tid deviceId contextId greenContextId streamId
```

`start`

/`end`

are the CPU-side runtime API call times. `gpu_start`

/`gpu_end`

are the GPU-side activity times. `name`

is the resolved API function name
(e.g., `"cudaLaunchKernel"`

). `pid`

and `tid`

are extracted from
`globalTid`

by bit field decomposition (`globalPid`

is dropped).

**CUDA_COMBINED_KERNEL**

```
start end globalTid correlationId gpu_start gpu_end pid tid deviceId shortName mangledName demangledName
```

Like `CUDA_COMBINED`

but kernel-only, with resolved kernel names instead of
runtime API name. `pid`

and `tid`

are extracted from `globalTid`

(`globalPid`

is dropped).

**NVTX**

```
text start end globalTid endGlobalTid domainId domainName eventType pid tid
```

`text`

is the resolved NVTX annotation string. `domainName`

is `"Default"`

if no domain was specified.

**NCCL**

```
text start end globalTid endGlobalTid domainId eventType jsonText pid tid
```

NCCL rows are filtered from NVTX to the domain named `"NCCL"`

and keep NVTX
timing/thread columns. `jsonText`

is present when advanced NCCL tracing payloads exist.

**NCCL_API**

```
text start end globalTid endGlobalTid domainId eventType jsonText count dataType rank pid tid
```

Extends `NCCL`

with parsed API payload fields (`count`

, `dataType`

,
`rank`

).

**NCCL_GPU_OPERATIONS**

```
localId (index) text start end commHash commRank count dataType operationClass operationId
```

One row per merged GPU operation (grouped from per-channel events). Includes
both collective and P2P operations, but only common NCCL GPU operation payload
fields. `operationClass`

identifies `"collective"`

versus `"p2p"`

operations, and the 64-bit numeric `operationId`

acts as unique id to correlated
collectives across all ranks as well as sends with their corresponding receives.
The id is unique across all collective and P2P operations.
`localId`

is the DataFrame index after grouping.

**NCCL_GPU_OPERATIONS_COLLECTIVE**

```
localId (index) text start end commHash commRank count dataType seqNumber apiId
```

One row per collective GPU operation merged across channels, not across ranks. This table exposes collective-specific payload fields.

**MPI / UCX**

```
globalTid start end text pid tid
```

All sub-tables concatenated, sorted by `start`

. `text`

is the resolved
operation name (e.g., `"MPI_Send"`

, `"MPI_Allreduce"`

).

**NIC**

```
start end globalId nicId value metricsListId metricsIdx GUID nic_name metric_name
```

**IB_SWITCH**

```
start end GUID value metricsListId metricsIdx metric_name
```

**GPU_METRICS**

```
timestamp typeId gpuId SMs Active SM Issue Tensor Active Unallocated Warps in Active SMs ...
```

Each metric is a column. The available columns depend on the GPU and capture settings.

**PERF_EVENTS**

```
start end vmId eventId count componentType cpu name
```

**GENERIC**

```
timestamp typeId genericEventId metricName metricValue dataSrc gpuId
```

#### Examples in Existing Recipes[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#examples-in-existing-recipes)

for NVTX range analysis`nvtx_gpu_proj_sum`

: Uses`CUDA_GPU_GRAPH`

+`NVTX`

: Uses`GENERIC`

for AWS EFA metrics

See also [Tutorial: Create a User-Defined Recipe](https://docs.nvidia.com#create-user-defined-recipe) for a step-by-step tutorial on
creating your own recipe.

### Tutorial: Create a User-Defined Recipe[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#tutorial-create-a-user-defined-recipe)

The Nsight Systems recipe system is designed to be extensible and we hope that many users will use it to create their own recipes. This short tutorial will highlight the steps needed to create a recipe that is a customized version of one of the recipes that is included in the Nsight Systems recipe package.

Before starting, you may want to review [Recipe Composite Tables](https://docs.nvidia.com#recipe-composite-tables) for an
overview of the pre-processed data tables available to recipes.

**Step 1: Create the recipe directory and script**

Make a new directory in the
`<install-dir>/target-linux-x64/python/packages/nsys_recipe/recipes`

folder based on
the name of your new recipe. For this example, we will call our new recipe
new_metric_util_map. We will copy the existing gpu_metric_util_map.py script
and create a new script called
new_metric_util_map.py in the new_metric_util_map directory. We will also
copy the heatmap.ipynb and metadata json files into the new_metric_util_map
directory. Type these steps in a Linux terminal window:

```
> cd <install-dir>/target-linux-x64/python/packages/nsys_recipe
> mkdir new_metric_util_map
> cp gpu_metric_util_map/metadata.json new_metric_util_map/metadata.json
> cp gpu_metric_util_map/heatmap.ipynb new_metric_util_map/heatmap.ipynb
> cp gpu_metric_util_map/gpu_metric_util_map.py new_metric_util_map/new_metric_util_map.py
```

Replace the module name in `metadata.json`

with new_metric_util_map
and update the display name and description to your preference. Also, rename
the class name `GpuMetricUtilMap`

in `new_metric_util_map.py`

to
`NewMetricUtilMap`

. We will discuss the detailed functionality of the new
recipe code in the subsequent steps.

**Step 2: Modify the mapper function**

Many recipes are structured as a map-reduce algorithm. The mapper function is called for every .nsys-rep file in the report directory. The mapper function performs a series of calculations on the events in each Nsight Systems report and produces an intermediate data set. The intermediate results are then combined by the reduce function to produce the final results. The mapper function can be called in parallel, either on multiple cores of a single node (using the concurrent python module), or multiple ranks of a multi-node recipe analysis (using the Dask distributed module).

When we create a new recipe, we need to create a class that derives from the Recipe base class. For our example, that class will be called NewMetricUtilMap (which we had renamed in step 1).

The mapper function is called mapper_func(). It will first convert the .nsys-rep
file into a data storage file (SQLite/Parquet/Arrow), if the file does
not already exist. It then reads all the necessary tables from the exported file
into Pandas Dataframes needed by the recipe. GPU Metric data is stored using a
database schema table called `GENERIC_EVENTS`

. For extra flexibility,
`GENERIC_EVENTS`

represents the data as a JSON object, which is stored as a string.
The `NewMetricUtilMap`

class extracts fields from the JSON object and accumulates
them over the histogram bins of the heat map.

The original script retrieved three GPU metrics: SM Active, SM Issue, and Tensor Active. In our new version of the script, we will extract a fourth metric, Unallocated Warps in Active SMs.

Find this line (approximately line 44):

metric_cols = ["SMs Active", "SM Issue", "Tensor Active"]

Add the Unallocated Warps in Active SMs metric:

metric_cols = [ "SMs Active", "SM Issue", "Tensor Active", "Unallocated Warps in Active SMs", ]


**Step 3: Modify the reduce function**

Our new mapper function will extract four GPU metrics and return them as a Pandas DataFrame. The reduce function receives a list of DataFrames, one for each .nsys-rep file in the analysis, and combines them into a single DataFrame using the Pandas concat function. Since the reducer function is generic in our case, no modifications are needed. However, if you would like to add any additional post-processing, you can do so in this function.

**Step 4: Add a plot to the Jupyter notebook**

Our new recipe class will create a Parquet output file with all the data
produced by the reducer function, using the `to_parquet()`

function. It will also
create a Jupyter notebook file using the `create_notebook()`

function.

In this step, we will change the `create_notebook()`

function to produce a plot
for our fourth metric. To do this, we need to change these two lines (located
in the second cell of `new_metric_util_map/heatmap.ipynb`

):

```
metrics = [
"SMs Active",
"SM Issue",
"Tensor Active",
]
```

To this:

```
metrics = [
"SMs Active",
"SM Issue",
"Tensor Active",
"Unallocated Warps in Active SMs",
]
```

That completes all the modifications for our NewMetricUtilMap class.

**Step 5: Run the new recipe**

If the new recipe is located in the default recipe directory nsys_recipe/recipes,
we can directly run it using the `nsys recipe`

command like this:

```
> nsys recipe new_metric_util_map --input <directory of reports>
```

It is also possible to have a recipe located outside of this directory. In this
case, you need to set the environment variable `NSYS_RECIPE_PATH`

to the directory
containing the recipe when running the `nsys recipe`

command.

When successful, the recipe should produce a new recipe result directory called
`new_metric_util_map-1`

.

If we open the Jupyter notebook in that recipe and execute the code, we should see our new heatmap along with the three plots produced by the original version of the recipe. Here is an example:

## Writing Post-Collection Events[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#writing-post-collection-events)

The `nsys_writer`

Python module writes NVTX events to a `.nsys-rep`

file
during post-collection analysis. It can augment Nsight Systems reports with
analysis results or data from external profiling sources.

`nsys_writer`

is the Nsight Systems integration for the `nvtx.writer`

module. For the writer object model and API, see [NVTX Python Writer](https://nvidia.github.io/NVTX/python/writer.html).

### Set up the writer[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#set-up-the-writer)

Install `nvtx`

version 0.2.16 or later in the Python environment that will
run `nsys_writer`

. For the default Linux `nsys recipe`

environment, after
the environment has been created, run:

```
$HOME/.nsightsystems/venv/bin/python -m pip install "nvtx>=0.2.16"
```

For another recipe environment or a standalone script, use the Python executable for that environment.

When `nsys_writer`

is used from an `nsys recipe`

, Nsight Systems
automatically selects the writer backend.

For a standalone Python script, install `nsys_writer`

package
in the Python environment. For example, on Linux x86-64:

```
/path/to/python -m pip install <nsys-install-folder>/target-linux-x64/python/packages/nsys_writer
```

Also set the `NSYS_WRITER_BACKEND`

environment variable to the
Nsight Systems writer backend library. For example, on Linux:

```
export NSYS_WRITER_BACKEND=<nsys-install-folder>/host-linux-x64/libNvtxwBackend.so
```

On Windows, the backend library is named `NvtxwBackend.dll`

. The backend is
loaded when the first `Session`

is created.

### Create a report[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#create-a-report)

The following example uses the default UTC time base to write a
three-millisecond range to `analysis.nsys-rep`

. `time.time_ns()`

provides
timestamps in nanoseconds since the Unix epoch:

```
import time
from nsys_writer import Session
start = time.time_ns()
with Session("analysis") as session:
domain = session.get_domain("My Analysis")
with session.create_stream("My Stream", domain=domain) as stream:
stream.write_pushpop(
start=start,
end=start + 3_000_000,
message="My Message",
color="green",
)
```

The session name determines the output path. Specify the desired path without
the `.nsys-rep`

suffix.

### Add events to an existing report[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#add-events-to-an-existing-report)

Pass `report_merge`

to copy an existing report and add events to the copy.
The session name determines the output path, which must differ from the
`report_merge`

path. Using the same path can truncate the source report on
Linux. With distinct paths, the original report is not modified. This example
creates `profile-annotated.nsys-rep`

and places the range on a custom scope
for derived analysis results:

```
from nsys_writer import Session, TimeBase
with Session(
name="profile-annotated",
report_merge="profile.nsys-rep",
time_base=TimeBase.RELATIVE,
) as session:
domain = session.get_domain("Analysis Results")
scope = domain.get_scope("Derived Analysis")
with session.create_stream(
"Post-Processing", domain=domain, scope=scope
) as stream:
stream.write_pushpop(
start=2_000_000,
end=6_000_000,
message="derived range",
)
```

The `report_merge`

path must identify an existing `.nsys-rep`

file.

### Choose a timestamp base[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#choose-a-timestamp-base)

Use a timestamp base that matches the source of the event timestamps:

`TimeBase.RELATIVE`

: nanoseconds relative to the report analysis start.`TimeBase.UTC`

(default): nanoseconds since the Unix epoch.`TimeBase.CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW`

: Linux`CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW`

nanoseconds.`TimeBase.CNTVCT`

: ARM virtual counter ticks.

Use `TimeBase.CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW`

or `TimeBase.CNTVCT`

when merging into a
report that contains matching clock-conversion data.

### API reference[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#api-reference)

`nsys_writer.Session`

inherits the event, counter, schema, domain, scope, and
stream APIs from `nvtx.writer.Session`

.
`nsys_writer.Session.create_stream`

does not expose the stream ordering and
skid controls available in `nvtx.writer.Session.create_stream`

because they
have no effect in this context.
For the complete API, including counter and batch-writing examples, see
the [NVTX Python Writer API reference](https://nvidia.github.io/NVTX/python/writer_reference.html).

## Available Export Formats[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#available-export-formats)

You may want to create your own analysis system interrogating the data produced by Nsight Systems. However, the .nsys-rep output format of Nsight Systems is not designed to be accessed by users, and we cannot guarantee its stability. Therefore you will want to export into a good format for your further processing.

### SQLite Schema Reference[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#sqlite-schema-reference)

Nsight Systems has the ability to export SQLite database files from the .nsys-rep
results file. From the CLI, use `nsys export`

. From the GUI, call
`File->Export...`

.

Note

The .nsys-rep report format is the only data format for Nsight Systems that should be considered forward-compatible. The SQLite schema can and will change in the future.

The schema for a concrete database can be obtained with the sqlite3 tool
built-in command `.schema`

. The sqlite3 tool can be located in the Target or
Host directory of your Nsight Systems installation.

Note

Currently, tables are created lazily, and therefore not every table described in the documentation will be present in a particular database. This will change in a future version of the product. If you want a full schema of all possible tables, use `nsys export --lazy=false`

during the export phase.

Currently, a table is created for each data type in the exported database. Since usage patterns for exported data may vary greatly and no default use cases have been established, no indexes or extra constraints are created. Instead, refer to the SQLite Examples section for a list of common recipes. This may change in a future version of the product.

To check the version of your exported SQLite file, check the value of
`EXPORT_SCHEMA_VERSION`

in the `META_DATA_EXPORT`

table. The schema version
is a common three-value major/minor/micro version number. The first value, or
major value, indicates the overall format of the database, and is only changed
if there is a major re-write or re-factor of the entire database format. It is
assumed that if the major version changes, all scripts or queries will break.
The middle, or minor, version is changed anytime there is a more localized, but
potentially breaking change, such as renaming an existing column, or changing
the type of an existing column. The last, or micro version is changed any time
there are additions, such as a new table or column, that should not introduce
any breaking change when used with well-written, best-practices queries.

The changes between schema versions are documented in
`<install_dir>/host*/exporter/export_schema_version_notes.txt`

.

This is the schema as of the 2026.5 release, schema version 3.30.1.

Note

When dynamic NVTX payload export is enabled (`nsys export --dynamic-tables=all`

),
each NVTX binary payload schema is additionally exported as its own data table
named `DYNAMIC_NVTXPAYLOAD_DATATYPE_<globalPid>_<domainId>_<schemaId>`

, with
one column per scalar field (plus a `..._<arrayFieldName>`

child table per
array field). A schema with no scalar fields gets no data table of its own —
only its array child tables (and its nested schemas’ tables); the
`NVTX_EVENTS_PAYLOAD_SCHEMAS`

and `NVTX_PAYLOAD_SCHEMA_RELATIONS`

rows
still record the schema. Because these names depend on the schemas present in
the report, they are not listed below. Join them back to `NVTX_EVENTS`

on `eventId`

;
see the SQLite Examples section for a worked example. This affects SQLite,
Arrow, and Arrow/Parquet directory exports only.

```
CREATE TABLE StringIds (

Note

GENERIC_EVENTS.typeId is a composite bit field that combines HW ID, VM ID, source ID, and type ID with the following structure:

<Hardware ID:8><VM ID:8><Source ID:16><Type ID:32>

The type ID is yet another composite bit field that combines the GPU metrics event tag and the GPU ID. To extract the latter, you need to get the lower 8 bits:

SELECT typeId & 0xFF AS gpuId FROM GENERIC_EVENTS

Note

The NET_DEVICE_* tables hold every network device, whatever its kind. A device’s kind is given by NET_DEVICE_TYPE_MAP.deviceType, which references ENUM_NET_DEVICE_TYPE and carries one row per set bit, so a device may appear with more than one type. Despite the similar name, ENUM_NET_DEVICE_TYPE is unrelated to ENUM_NET_DEVICE_ID, which labels NIC PCIe device IDs.

CollectX does not report Ethernet switches GUIDs. Therefore, we use the switch name’s hash as the switch identifier in NET_DEVICE_PORT_INFO and NET_DEVICE_TYPE_MAP. The hash is stable, allowing running joins between tables. The switch name is held in NET_DEVICE_INFO.name.

Some event types have been deprecated and are no longer supported by Nsight Systems. While tables for these event will no longer appear in exported SQL databases, databases exported by older versions of Nsight Systems may still contain them.

**OSRT Event Class Values**

OS runtime libraries can be traced to gather information about low-level userspace APIs. This traces the system call wrappers and thread synchronization interfaces exposed by the C runtime and POSIX Threads (pthread) libraries. This does not perform a complete runtime library API trace, but instead focuses on the functions that can take a long time to execute, or could potentially cause your thread be unscheduled from the CPU while waiting for an event to complete.

OSRT events may have callchains attached to them, depending on selected profiling settings. In such cases, one can use callchainId column to select relevant callchains from OSRT_CALLCHAINS table

### Common SQLite Examples[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#common-sqlite-examples)

**Common Helper Commands**

When utilizing the sqlite3 command line tool, it’s helpful to have data printed as named columns, this can be done with:

```
.mode column
.headers on
```

The default column width is determined by the data in the first row of results. If this doesn’t work out well, you can specify widths manually.

```
.width 10 20 50
```

**Obtaining Sample Report**

The CLI interface of Nsight Systems was used to profile the radixSortThrust CUDA sample, then the resulting .nsys-rep file was exported using the nsys export.

```
nsys profile --trace=cuda,osrt radixSortThrust
nsys export --type sqlite report1.nsys-rep
```

**Serialized Process and Thread Identifiers**

Note

The globalTid field is a 64-bit identifier that encodes multiple components into a single value: <Hardware ID:8><VM ID:8><Process ID:24><Thread ID:24> It follows the structure:

Thread ID: bits 0–23

Process ID: bits 24–47

VM ID: bits 48–55

Hardware ID: bits 56–63


**Goal:** Extract readable process ID (PID) and thread ID (TID) values from
Nsight Systems’s serialized identifier format.

Nsight Systems stores identifiers where events originated in serialized form to efficiently pack multiple values into a single field. This example shows how to decode them back to standard PID/TID format.

**What the code does:** Uses bit shifting and modulo operations to extract the
embedded PID and TID values from the globalTid field.

For events that have globalTid or globalPid fields exported, use the following code to extract numeric TID and PID.

```
SELECT globalTid / 0x1000000 % 0x1000000 AS PID, globalTid % 0x1000000 AS TID FROM TABLE_NAME;
```

```
# Python equivalent:
def extract_pid_tid(global_tid):
PID = (global_tid // 0x1000000) % 0x1000000
TID = global_tid % 0x1000000
return PID, TID
```

Note

globalTid field includes both TID and PID values, while globalPid only contains the PID value.

**Read NVTX Binary Payload Fields**

**Goal:** Read the fields of an NVTX binary payload alongside the event that
carried it.

When exported with `nsys export --dynamic-tables=all`

, each NVTX binary payload
schema becomes its own table named
`DYNAMIC_NVTXPAYLOAD_DATATYPE_<globalPid>_<domainId>_<schemaId>`

, one row per
payload instance. The `NVTX_EVENTS_PAYLOAD_SCHEMAS`

link table maps each event
to the `globalPid`

, `domainId`

, and `payloadSchemaID`

that name its table.

**What the code does:** Lists the payload links, then joins one payload table
back to `NVTX_EVENTS`

on `eventId`

to read the payload fields together with
the event’s timing and text.

```
SELECT eventId, globalPid, domainId, payloadSchemaID FROM NVTX_EVENTS_PAYLOAD_SCHEMAS;
```

Substitute the ids from a row above into the table name.

```
SELECT e.start, e.end, e.text, d.*
FROM DYNAMIC_NVTXPAYLOAD_DATATYPE_<globalPid>_<domainId>_<payloadSchemaID> AS d
JOIN NVTX_EVENTS AS e USING (eventId);
```

Note

The same tables and join are available in the Arrow, Arrow directory, and
Parquet directory exports. SQLite has no unsigned or fixed-width integer
types, so payload columns typed `uint8`

/`uint16`

/`uint32`

/`uint64`

or
32-bit `float`

are widened to signed 64-bit integers or `REAL`

in a SQLite
export, while those formats preserve the payload’s native column types.

**Understanding Event Types and Tags**

Many tables in the nsys SQLite export use numeric codes for event types, tags, and classes. These codes represent different categories of events:

**Event Types**: Identify the kind of operation or marker (e.g., NVTX marks vs ranges)**Tags**: Specify event phases like BEGIN/END for state transitions**Event Classes**: Categorize broad event categories (e.g., different types of GPU operations)

When you see numeric values in queries, refer to the documentation sections above or query the relevant string tables to understand their meanings.

**Correlate CUDA Kernel Launches With CUDA API Kernel Launches**

**Goal:** Link CUDA runtime API calls to the actual GPU kernels they launch,
enabling analysis of which API calls resulted in the longest-running kernels.

**What the code does:**
1. Adds human-readable columns to the runtime table
2. Joins runtime API calls with GPU kernel executions using correlation IDs
3. Populates kernel names and API function names from the string table
4. Finds the 10 longest API calls that resulted in kernel execution

```
ALTER TABLE CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME ADD COLUMN name TEXT;
ALTER TABLE CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME ADD COLUMN kernelName TEXT;
UPDATE CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME SET kernelName =
(SELECT value FROM StringIds
JOIN CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_KERNEL AS cuda_gpu
ON cuda_gpu.shortName = StringIds.id
AND CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME.correlationId = cuda_gpu.correlationId);
UPDATE CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME SET name =
(SELECT value FROM StringIds WHERE nameId = StringIds.id);
```

Select the 10 longest CUDA API ranges that resulted in kernel execution.

```
SELECT name, kernelName, start, end FROM CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME
WHERE kernelName IS NOT NULL ORDER BY end - start LIMIT 10;
```

```
# Python equivalent workflow:
# 1. Load runtime and kernel data
# 2. Join on correlation_id to match API calls with kernels
# 3. Add readable names from string table
# 4. Sort by duration and get top 10
runtime_with_kernels = runtime.merge(kernels, on='correlationId')
runtime_with_kernels['duration'] = runtime_with_kernels['end'] - runtime_with_kernels['start']
top_10_longest = runtime_with_kernels.nlargest(10, 'duration')
```

Results:

```
name kernelName start end

```

**Remove Ranges Overlapping With Overhead**

**Goal:** Identify and remove CUDA API calls that overlap with profiler overhead
to get cleaner performance measurements.

**What the code does:** Uses spatial overlap detection to find CUDA runtime
ranges that intersect with profiler overhead periods. The query checks for three
types of overlap: range starts within overhead, range ends within overhead, or
range completely encompasses overhead.

Use the this query to count CUDA API ranges overlapping with the overhead ones.

Replace “SELECT COUNT(*)” with “DELETE” to remove such ranges.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME WHERE rowid IN
(
SELECT cuda.rowid
FROM PROFILER_OVERHEAD as overhead
INNER JOIN CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME as cuda ON
(cuda.start BETWEEN overhead.start and overhead.end)
OR (cuda.end BETWEEN overhead.start and overhead.end)
OR (cuda.start < overhead.start AND cuda.end > overhead.end)
);
```

```
# Python equivalent for finding overlaps:
def ranges_overlap(range1_start, range1_end, range2_start, range2_end):
return (range1_start <= range2_end and range1_end >= range2_start)
overlapping_ranges = []
for cuda_range in cuda_ranges:
for overhead_range in overhead_ranges:
if ranges_overlap(cuda_range.start, cuda_range.end,
overhead_range.start, overhead_range.end):
overlapping_ranges.append(cuda_range)
```

Results:

```
COUNT(*)
----------
1095
```

**Find CUDA API Calls that Resulted in the Original Graph Node Creation**

**Goal:** Identify which CUDA API calls were responsible for creating the
original nodes in CUDA graphs (as opposed to cloned or instantiated nodes).

**What the code does:**
1. Filters graph nodes to find only original creations (those without originalGraphNodeId)
2. Groups by graphNodeId to get the first occurrence
3. Correlates with CUDA runtime API calls that were active when the graph node was created
4. Joins with string table to get readable API function names

```
SELECT graph.graphNodeId, api.start, graph.start as graphStart, api.end,
api.globalTid, api.correlationId, api.globalTid,
(SELECT value FROM StringIds where api.nameId == id) as name
FROM CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME as api
JOIN
(
SELECT start, graphNodeId, globalTid from CUDA_GRAPH_NODE_EVENTS
GROUP BY graphNodeId
HAVING COUNT(originalGraphNodeId) = 0
) as graph
ON api.globalTid == graph.globalTid AND api.start < graph.start AND api.end > graph.start
ORDER BY graphNodeId;
```

Results:

```
graphNodeId start graphStart end globalTid correlationId globalTid name

**Backtraces for OSRT Ranges**

**Goal:** Analyze operating system runtime (OSRT) function calls with their full
call stacks to understand performance bottlenecks and call patterns.

**What the code does:**
1. Adds human-readable columns for function names, symbol names, and module names
2. Populates these from the string table for better readability
3. Shows how to query the longest OSRT call with its complete backtrace

Adding text columns makes results of the query below more human-readable.

```
ALTER TABLE OSRT_API ADD COLUMN name TEXT;
UPDATE OSRT_API SET name = (SELECT value FROM StringIds WHERE OSRT_API.nameId = StringIds.id);
ALTER TABLE OSRT_CALLCHAINS ADD COLUMN symbolName TEXT;
UPDATE OSRT_CALLCHAINS SET symbolName = (SELECT value FROM StringIds WHERE symbol = StringIds.id);
ALTER TABLE OSRT_CALLCHAINS ADD COLUMN moduleName TEXT;
UPDATE OSRT_CALLCHAINS SET moduleName = (SELECT value FROM StringIds WHERE module = StringIds.id);
```

Print backtrace of the longest OSRT range.

```
SELECT globalTid / 0x1000000 % 0x1000000 AS PID, globalTid % 0x1000000 AS TID,
start, end, name, callchainId, stackDepth, symbolName, moduleName
FROM OSRT_API LEFT JOIN OSRT_CALLCHAINS ON callchainId == OSRT_CALLCHAINS.id
WHERE OSRT_API.rowid IN (SELECT rowid FROM OSRT_API ORDER BY end - start DESC LIMIT 1)
ORDER BY stackDepth LIMIT 10;
```

```
# Python equivalent for finding longest call with backtrace:
longest_call = osrt_api.loc[osrt_api['duration'].idxmax()]
backtrace = osrt_callchains[osrt_callchains['id'] == longest_call['callchainId']]
backtrace_ordered = backtrace.sort_values('stackDepth')
```

Results:

```

Profiled processes output streams.

**Goal:** Access stdout and stderr output from profiled processes to correlate
application output with performance data.

**What the code does:** Resolves file paths and content from string IDs to show
the captured stdout/stderr streams from profiled applications.

```
ALTER TABLE ProcessStreams ADD COLUMN filename TEXT;
UPDATE ProcessStreams SET filename = (SELECT value FROM StringIds WHERE ProcessStreams.filenameId = StringIds.id);
ALTER TABLE ProcessStreams ADD COLUMN content TEXT;
UPDATE ProcessStreams SET content = (SELECT value FROM StringIds WHERE ProcessStreams.contentId = StringIds.id);
```

Select all collected stdout and stderr streams.

```
select globalPid / 0x1000000 % 0x1000000 AS PID, filename, content from ProcessStreams;
```

**Thread Summary**

**Goal:** Calculate CPU utilization statistics per thread to identify which
threads are consuming the most CPU resources.

Note that Nsight Systems applies additional logic during sampling events processing to work around lost events. This means that the results of the below query might differ slightly from the ones shown in “Analysis Summary” tab.

**Approach 1: Using CPU Cycles (when available)**

**What this code does:** Calculates thread CPU utilization using hardware
performance counter data (CPU cycles) which provides the most accurate
measurement of actual CPU usage per thread.

```
SELECT
globalTid / 0x1000000 % 0x1000000 AS PID,
globalTid % 0x1000000 AS TID,
ROUND(100.0 * SUM(cpuCycles) /
(
SELECT SUM(cpuCycles) FROM COMPOSITE_EVENTS
GROUP BY globalTid / 0x1000000000000 % 0x100
),
2
) as CPU_utilization,
(SELECT value FROM StringIds WHERE id =
(
SELECT nameId FROM ThreadNames
WHERE ThreadNames.globalTid = COMPOSITE_EVENTS.globalTid
)
) as thread_name
FROM COMPOSITE_EVENTS
GROUP BY globalTid
ORDER BY CPU_utilization DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Results:

```
PID TID CPU_utilization thread_name

19163 19168 1.35 CUPTI worker th
19163 19166 0.25 [NS]
```

**Approach 2: Using Scheduling Events (when PMU data not available)**

**What this approach does:** When CPU cycle counter data is not collected, this
method calculates thread CPU time based on scheduling events (when threads are
scheduled in/out), then calculates utilization percentages. This approach is
less precise but still useful for understanding relative thread activity.

```
CREATE INDEX sched_start ON SCHED_EVENTS (start);
CREATE TABLE CPU_USAGE AS
SELECT
first.globalTid as globalTid,
(SELECT nameId FROM ThreadNames WHERE ThreadNames.globalTid = first.globalTid) as nameId,
sum(second.start - first.start) as total_duration,
count() as ranges_count
FROM SCHED_EVENTS as first
LEFT JOIN SCHED_EVENTS as second
ON second.rowid =
(
SELECT rowid
FROM SCHED_EVENTS
WHERE start > first.start AND globalTid = first.globalTid
ORDER BY start ASC
LIMIT 1
)
WHERE first.isSchedIn != 0
GROUP BY first.globalTid
ORDER BY total_duration DESC;
SELECT
globalTid / 0x1000000 % 0x1000000 AS PID,
globalTid % 0x1000000 AS TID,
(SELECT value FROM StringIds where nameId == id) as thread_name,
ROUND(100.0 * total_duration / (SELECT SUM(total_duration) FROM CPU_USAGE), 2) as CPU_utilization
FROM CPU_USAGE
ORDER BY CPU_utilization DESC;
```

```
# Python equivalent for scheduling-based calculation:
def calculate_thread_cpu_time(sched_events):
cpu_usage = {}
for tid in unique_tids:
tid_events = sched_events[sched_events['globalTid'] == tid]
tid_events = tid_events[tid_events['isSchedIn'] == 1] # Only sched-in events
total_time = 0
for i in range(len(tid_events) - 1):
time_slice = tid_events.iloc[i+1]['start'] - tid_events.iloc[i]['start']
total_time += time_slice
cpu_usage[tid] = total_time
return cpu_usage
```

Results:

```

**Function Table**

**Goal:** Create profiler-style function tables showing flat view (total time
in each function across all call stacks) and bottom-up view (time spent directly
in each function).

**What the code does:** Processes sampling callchain data to calculate time
spent in functions, providing two views commonly used in profilers.

These examples demonstrate how to calculate Flat and BottomUp (for top level only) views statistics.

To set up:

```
ALTER TABLE SAMPLING_CALLCHAINS ADD COLUMN symbolName TEXT;
UPDATE SAMPLING_CALLCHAINS SET symbolName = (SELECT value FROM StringIds WHERE symbol = StringIds.id);
ALTER TABLE SAMPLING_CALLCHAINS ADD COLUMN moduleName TEXT;
UPDATE SAMPLING_CALLCHAINS SET moduleName = (SELECT value FROM StringIds WHERE module = StringIds.id);
```

To get flat view:

**Flat view:** Shows total time spent in each function across all call stacks (inclusive time).

```
SELECT symbolName, moduleName, ROUND(100.0 * sum(cpuCycles) /
(SELECT SUM(cpuCycles) FROM COMPOSITE_EVENTS), 2) AS flatTimePercentage
FROM SAMPLING_CALLCHAINS
LEFT JOIN COMPOSITE_EVENTS ON SAMPLING_CALLCHAINS.id == COMPOSITE_EVENTS.id
GROUP BY symbol, module
ORDER BY flatTimePercentage DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

To get BottomUp view (top level only):

**Bottom-up view:** Shows time spent directly in each function (exclusive time, only leaf functions in call stacks).

```
SELECT symbolName, moduleName, ROUND(100.0 * sum(cpuCycles) /
(SELECT SUM(cpuCycles) FROM COMPOSITE_EVENTS), 2) AS selfTimePercentage
FROM SAMPLING_CALLCHAINS
LEFT JOIN COMPOSITE_EVENTS ON SAMPLING_CALLCHAINS.id == COMPOSITE_EVENTS.id
WHERE stackDepth == 0
GROUP BY symbol, module
ORDER BY selfTimePercentage DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

```
# Python equivalent:
# Flat view - aggregate all occurrences of each function
flat_view = callchains.groupby(['symbol', 'module'])['cpuCycles'].sum()
flat_percentages = (flat_view / total_cycles * 100).sort_values(ascending=False)

**DX12 API Frame Duration Histogram**

**Goal:** Analyze DirectX 12 application frame timing by measuring the duration between consecutive Present calls and creating a timing histogram.

**What the code does:**
1. Creates a view that pairs consecutive Present calls to calculate frame durations
2. Groups frame durations into millisecond buckets
3. Counts how many frames fall into each duration bucket

The example demonstrates how to calculate DX12 CPU frames durartion and construct a histogram out of it.

```
CREATE INDEX DX12_API_ENDTS ON DX12_API (end);
CREATE TEMP VIEW DX12_API_FPS AS SELECT end AS start,
(SELECT end FROM DX12_API
WHERE end > outer.end AND nameId == (SELECT id FROM StringIds
WHERE value == "IDXGISwapChain::Present")
ORDER BY end ASC LIMIT 1) AS end
FROM DX12_API AS outer
WHERE nameId == (SELECT id FROM StringIds WHERE value == "IDXGISwapChain::Present")
ORDER BY end;
```

Number of frames with a duration of [X, X + 1] milliseconds.

```
SELECT
CAST((end - start) / 1000000.0 AS INT) AS duration_ms,
count(*)
FROM DX12_API_FPS
WHERE end IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY duration_ms
ORDER BY duration_ms;
```

```
# Python equivalent:
present_calls = dx12_api[dx12_api['function_name'] == 'IDXGISwapChain::Present']
present_calls = present_calls.sort_values('end')
frame_durations = []
for i in range(len(present_calls) - 1):
duration = present_calls.iloc[i+1]['end'] - present_calls.iloc[i]['end']
duration_ms = duration / 1000000.0 # Convert to milliseconds
frame_durations.append(int(duration_ms))
# Create histogram
histogram = pd.Series(frame_durations).value_counts().sort_index()
```

Results:

**GPU Context Switch Events Enumeration**

**Goal:** Track GPU context switches to understand GPU scheduling behavior and
identify context switch patterns.

**What the code does:** Filters GPU context switch events to show only BEGIN
(tag=8) and END (tag=7) events, which mark the boundaries of GPU context
execution periods.

**GPU Context Switch Event Tags:**
- **7**: END events (context execution ends)
- **8**: BEGIN events (context execution begins)

GPU context duration is between first BEGIN and a matching END event.

```
SELECT (CASE tag WHEN 8 THEN "BEGIN" WHEN 7 THEN "END" END) AS tag,
globalPid / 0x1000000 % 0x1000000 AS PID,
vmId, seqNo, contextId, timestamp, gpuId FROM GPU_CONTEXT_SWITCH_EVENTS
WHERE tag in (7, 8) ORDER BY seqNo LIMIT 10;
```

Results:

**Resolve NVTX Category Name**

**Goal:** Decode NVTX category names for NVTX markers and ranges to make the
profiling data more human-readable.

**What the code does:** Joins NVTX events with their category definitions to
resolve category IDs into meaningful category names, making it easier to
understand the purpose of different NVTX annotations.

**NVTX Event Types:**



33: Category definition events (define new categories)

34: Mark events (instantaneous markers)

59: Push/Pop range events (nested ranges)

60: Start/End range events (paired ranges)

The example demonstrates how to resolve NVTX category name for NVTX marks and ranges.

```
WITH
event AS (
SELECT *
FROM NVTX_EVENTS
WHERE eventType IN (34, 59, 60) -- mark, push/pop, start/end
),
category AS (
SELECT
category,
domainId,
text AS categoryName
FROM NVTX_EVENTS
WHERE eventType == 33 -- category definition events
)
SELECT
start,
end,
globalTid,
eventType,
domainId,
category,
categoryName,

FROM event JOIN category USING (category, domainId)
ORDER BY start;
```

Results:

**Rename CUDA Kernels with NVTX**

**Goal:** Associate CUDA kernels with their surrounding NVTX ranges to provide
more meaningful names and context for kernel analysis.

**What the code does:**
1. Finds the innermost NVTX push-pop range that encompasses each CUDA kernel launch
2. Maps the NVTX range text to the corresponding kernel execution
3. Enables analysis of kernels by their logical function rather than just their technical names

The example demonstrates how to map innermost NVTX push-pop range to a matching CUDA kernel run.

```
ALTER TABLE CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_KERNEL ADD COLUMN nvtxRange TEXT;
CREATE INDEX nvtx_start ON NVTX_EVENTS (start);
UPDATE CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_KERNEL SET nvtxRange = (
SELECT NVTX_EVENTS.text
FROM NVTX_EVENTS JOIN CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME ON
NVTX_EVENTS.eventType == 59 AND
NVTX_EVENTS.globalTid == CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME.globalTid AND
NVTX_EVENTS.start <= CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME.start AND
NVTX_EVENTS.end >= CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME.end
WHERE
CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_KERNEL.correlationId == CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME.correlationId
ORDER BY NVTX_EVENTS.start DESC LIMIT 1
);
SELECT start, end, globalPid, StringIds.value as shortName, nvtxRange
FROM CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_KERNEL JOIN StringIds ON shortName == id
ORDER BY start LIMIT 6;
```

```
# Python equivalent:
def find_innermost_nvtx_range(kernel_start, kernel_end, nvtx_ranges):
# Find NVTX ranges that completely contain the kernel
containing_ranges = []
for nvtx in nvtx_ranges:
if nvtx['start'] <= kernel_start and nvtx['end'] >= kernel_end:
containing_ranges.append(nvtx)
# Return the innermost (latest starting) range
if containing_ranges:
return max(containing_ranges, key=lambda x: x['start'])['text']
return None
```

**Select CUDA Calls With Backtraces**

**Goal:** Analyze CUDA API calls along with their call stacks to understand the
application code paths that lead to CUDA API usage.

**What the code does:** Joins CUDA runtime API calls with their associated call
chains to show the complete stack trace for each CUDA call, helping identify
where in the application CUDA calls originate.

```
ALTER TABLE CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME ADD COLUMN name TEXT;
UPDATE CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME SET name = (SELECT value FROM StringIds WHERE CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME.nameId = StringIds.id);
ALTER TABLE CUDA_CALLCHAINS ADD COLUMN symbolName TEXT;

**SLI Peer-to-Peer Query**

**Goal:** Filter and analyze SLI (Scalable Link Interface) peer-to-peer memory
transfers between GPUs based on size, timing, and other criteria.

**What the code does:** Demonstrates how to query SLI P2P events with filtering
conditions on resource size, time range, and sorting by transfer size to
identify significant GPU-to-GPU transfers.

**SLI P2P Event Classes:**
- **62**: Peer-to-peer transfer events between GPUs

The example demonstrates how to query SLI Peer-to-Peer events with resource size greater than value and within a time range sorted by resource size descending.

```
SELECT *
FROM SLI_P2P
WHERE resourceSize < 98304 AND start > 1568063100 AND end < 1579468901
ORDER BY resourceSize DESC;
```

```
# Python equivalent:

(sli_p2p['resourceSize'] < 98304) &
(sli_p2p['start'] > 1568063100) &
(sli_p2p['end'] < 1579468901)
].sort_values('resourceSize', ascending=False)
```

**Generic Events**

**Goal:** Analyze system-level events captured through generic event collection (like ftrace) to understand system behavior and syscall patterns.

**What the code does:** Demonstrates how to query generic events stored in JSON format, specifically showing how to create a histogram of syscall usage by process ID. The query uses a subquery to find the specific event type ID for “raw_syscalls:sys_enter” events, then counts occurrences by process ID.

Syscall usage histogram by PID:

```
SELECT json_extract(data, '$.common_pid') AS PID, count(*) AS total
FROM GENERIC_EVENTS WHERE PID IS NOT NULL AND typeId = (
SELECT typeId FROM GENERIC_EVENT_TYPES
WHERE json_extract(data, '$.Name') = "raw_syscalls:sys_enter")
GROUP BY PID
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

```
# Python equivalent:
import json
# Filter for syscall enter events
syscall_events = []
for event in generic_events:
data = json.loads(event['data'])
if 'common_pid' in data:
syscall_events.append(data['common_pid'])
# Count syscalls by PID
pid_counts = pd.Series(syscall_events).value_counts().head(10)
```

Results:

```

**Fetching Generic Events in JSON Format**

**Goal:** Export generic events, types, and sources in JSON format for external
analysis tools or custom processing pipelines.

**What the code does:** Constructs JSON objects from the database tables
containing generic event data, enabling export to JSON Lines format for further
processing with external tools.

Use the below queries (without the LIMIT clause) to extract JSON lines representation of generic events, types, and sources.

```
SELECT json_insert('{}',
'$.sourceId', sourceId,
'$.data', json(data)
)
FROM GENERIC_EVENT_SOURCES LIMIT 2;
SELECT json_insert('{}',

### Arrow[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#arrow)

The Arrow type exported file, `.arrows`

, uses the IPC stream format to store all tables in a
file. The tables can be read by opening the file as an arrow stream. For example one can use the
`open_stream`

function from the arrow python package. For more information on the interfaces that
can be used to read an IPC stream file, please refer to the Apache Arrow documentation
[[1](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/api/ipc.html), [2](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/ipc.html)].

The name of each table is included in the schema metadata. Thus, while reading each table, the user
can extract the table title from the metadata. The table name metadata field has the key
`table_name`

. The titles of all the available tables can be found in section
[SQLite Schema Reference](https://docs.nvidia.com/index.html#sqlite-schema-reference).

A sample function that reads all Arrow tables in a `.arrows`

file is provided below in Python:

```
import pyarrow as pa
def read_tables(arrow_file):
with pa.input_stream(arrow_file) as source:
while source.tell() < source.size():
try:
yield pa.ipc.open_stream(arrow_file).read_all()
except:
continue
```

The Arrow directory exporter type, `_arwdir`

, will create a directory with one arrow file per
table/dataset.

### JSON Lines[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#json-lines)

In the JSON Lines export format ([JSON Lines Documentation](https://jsonlines.org/)),
events and other report data (such as strings and processes) are serialized into JSON
objects, with each object written to a new line.

Output layout:

```
{"id":0,"table":"StringIds","value":"[Unknown]"}
{"globalPid":284057963331584,"name":"chrome","pid":153958,"table":"PROCESSES"}
{"globalTid":281523009882942,"nameId":442,"priority":20,"table":"ThreadNames"}
{"name":"COLLECT_GPU_CTX_SW_TRACE","table":"META_DATA_CAPTURE","value":"false"}
...
```

Note the presence of the “table” field in each JSON object. This field allows readers to identify
the type of the event and corresponds to the table name in the `sqlite`

export.

## Common Analysis Pitfalls[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#common-analysis-pitfalls)

This section collects common mistakes made when interpreting Nsight Systems traces and when querying the exported SQLite database. The first subsection covers domain-level misconceptions about GPU/CPU performance; the second covers SQL traps specific to the Nsight Systems SQLite schema.

### GPU Performance Analysis Pitfalls[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#gpu-performance-analysis-pitfalls)

When interpreting GPU/CPU performance traces, a handful of misconceptions
recur and lead to incorrect conclusions. Each entry below pairs a common but
**wrong** assumption with the **correct** interpretation.

#### CPU vs GPU cost confusion[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cpu-vs-gpu-cost-confusion)

##### Resolution does not affect CPU-side API call cost[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#resolution-does-not-affect-cpu-side-api-call-cost)

**Wrong**: “Present() / Draw() / Dispatch() / vkQueueSubmit() takes longer at higher resolutions because there are more pixels to process.”**Correct**: The CPU cost of issuing these API calls is resolution-independent. The CPU records a command; it does not process pixels. GPU-side work (compositing, copying the back-buffer) may scale with resolution, but that work is asynchronous and does not appear on the CPU timeline unless explicitly synchronized via a fence or wait.

##### Command-buffer submission cost is not proportional to GPU workload[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#command-buffer-submission-cost-is-not-proportional-to-gpu-workload)

**Wrong**: “Submitting more complex shaders takes longer on the CPU.”**Correct**: CPU-side command recording and submission cost is driven by the number and type of API calls, state changes, and descriptor updates – not by shader complexity or GPU workload size.

#### Synchronization and async operations[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#synchronization-and-async-operations)

##### Async compute / copy does not block the CPU[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#async-compute-copy-does-not-block-the-cpu)

**Wrong**: “The async compute work is causing a CPU stall.”**Correct**: Work submitted to async compute or copy queues does not block the CPU timeline unless the application explicitly waits on a fence tied to that work. If a CPU stall coincides with async GPU work, the stall is caused by whatever fence or event the CPU is waiting on – identify the specific synchronization point.

##### Fence waits vs work completion[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#fence-waits-vs-work-completion)

**Wrong**: “The CPU is waiting for the GPU to finish [specific pass].”**Correct**: The CPU waits on a**fence value**, not on a specific pass. The fence may be signaled after multiple passes complete. Identify which fence the CPU is waiting on and what GPU work signals that fence.

#### Barrier and synchronization costs[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#barrier-and-synchronization-costs)

##### Barriers have separate CPU and GPU costs[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#barriers-have-separate-cpu-and-gpu-costs)

**Wrong**: “Barriers are expensive”.**Correct**: Resource barriers have two distinct costs at different points in time:**CPU cost**: recording the barrier into the command buffer (typically negligible per-barrier, but can accumulate with hundreds per frame).**GPU cost**: cache flush / invalidate and possible decompression (varies enormously by resource size, transition type, split-vs-immediate).

Always check and specify which cost you mean and cite measurements for the specific barrier(s) in question.


##### Barrier storms: count matters, but not all barriers are equal[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#barrier-storms-count-matters-but-not-all-barriers-are-equal)

**Wrong**: “This frame has 200 barriers, so barriers are the bottleneck.”**Correct**: Barrier count alone does not determine cost. A barrier transitioning a small buffer between shader stages costs far less than one decompressing a render target. Evaluate barrier cost by measuring GPU time consumed by barrier operations, not by counting them.

#### Draw calls and rendering cost[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#draw-calls-and-rendering-cost)

##### Draw-call count is not the primary cost driver[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#draw-call-count-is-not-the-primary-cost-driver)

**Wrong**: “The frame has 5000 draw calls, so draw-call overhead is the problem.”**Correct**: On modern APIs (D3D12, Vulkan), per-draw CPU overhead is minimal because command recording is explicit and multi-threaded. The cost drivers are: state changes between draws (PSO switches, root signature / pipeline-layout changes, descriptor table / set updates), command-buffer structure, and GPU-side work per draw. A frame with 5000 draws but few state changes may be faster than one with 500 draws and frequent PSO switches.

#### Memory and bandwidth[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#memory-and-bandwidth)

##### Theoretical peak bandwidth is not achieved bandwidth[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#theoretical-peak-bandwidth-is-not-achieved-bandwidth)

**Wrong**: “The GPU has 1 TB/s bandwidth, so this shader should be able to read X GB in Y ms.”**Correct**: Achieved memory bandwidth depends on access pattern, cache behavior, and contention. Real-world utilization is typically 60-85% of theoretical peak for well-optimized compute workloads, lower for mixed graphics workloads. Use measured bandwidth (from profiler SOL metrics) rather than theoretical calculations.

##### VRAM capacity vs bandwidth[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#vram-capacity-vs-bandwidth)

**Wrong**: “The game uses 8 GB of VRAM, so memory is under pressure.”**Correct**: VRAM capacity usage and bandwidth usage are independent concerns. A game can use most of VRAM without any bandwidth bottleneck (textures resident but not actively sampled), or it can have severe bandwidth pressure while using a fraction of capacity. Identify which dimension is the actual concern.

#### Timing and measurement[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#timing-and-measurement)

##### API wall-clock duration is not active CPU time[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#api-wall-clock-duration-is-not-active-cpu-time)

**Wrong**: “`UpdateTileMappings`

/`vkAllocateMemory`

took 14.5 ms – that’s 14.5 ms of CPU work.”**Correct**: API call durations from`DX12_API`

/`DXGI_API`

/`VULKAN_API`

tables are**wall-clock**from call start to call return. That includes: (a) on-CPU execution, (b) kernel lock waits (e.g. DXGI Present contending with DWM), (c) user-mode waits (e.g. fence waits), (d) scheduling delays while the thread is runnable but off-CPU. A 14.5 ms call may be 2 ms of CPU work and 12.5 ms blocked. Distinguish wall-clock from active CPU time using`SCHED_EVENTS`

to see on-CPU vs blocked within the call window.

##### Present / vkQueuePresentKHR latency vs frame time[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#present-vkqueuepresentkhr-latency-vs-frame-time)

**Wrong**: “Present takes 5 ms, which is adding to frame time.”**Correct**: Present latency (time from CPU call to actual flip / display) includes wait time for vsync, compositor, and display refresh. This latency is largely not the application’s GPU/CPU work. Distinguish between: (a) CPU time spent in the Present call (which may include a blocking wait), (b) GPU time for any associated copy/composite, and (c) display latency (vsync alignment, present-mode queueing).

#### Investigation discipline[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#investigation-discipline)

##### Reversed causation[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#reversed-causation)

GPU idle, paging bursts, and fence waits during a slow window are often **consequences**, not causes. Always trace backward to find the initiator (the operation that pushed VRAM over budget, the thread that took the lock, the API call that blocked).

### SQLite Schema Pitfalls[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#sqlite-schema-pitfalls)

Common SQL traps and misinterpretations when querying the `.sqlite`

database
produced by `nsys export`

. Read these alongside the [SQLite Schema Reference](https://docs.nvidia.com#sqlite-schema)
(table columns, ID encoding, timestamps, and query patterns) and the GPU
performance analysis pitfalls above.

#### Timestamp filtering[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#timestamp-filtering)

`startTime`

/`stopTime`

in metadata are**wall-clock**times,**not**event-timestamp references – never use them to filter events. Filter against the trace-relative`timestamp`

column (in nanoseconds) instead. See the[SQLite Schema Reference](https://docs.nvidia.com#sqlite-schema)for the timestamp model.

#### SCHED_EVENTS gotchas[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#sched-events-gotchas)

**No**`end`

**or**`duration`

**column.**Compute on-CPU intervals with`LEAD(start) OVER (PARTITION BY globalTid ORDER BY start)`

.`threadBlock`

is only meaningful when`isSchedIn = 0`

. Reading it on a sched-in event gives a stale value from the previous off-CPU transition.

##### Attribution rule (block reason vs thread state)[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#attribution-rule-block-reason-vs-thread-state)

Interpret the (block reason, thread state) **pair**, not the block reason alone – the value lists are in [SQLite Schema Event Values](https://docs.nvidia.com#sqlite-schema-event-values). Before concluding lock contention, verify the stalled thread’s `threadBlock`

shows a blocking reason (`Resource`

, `UserRequest`

, `KeyedEvent`

) during the specific window. `NonBlocked`

/ `Running`

means the thread was actively computing and got preempted – that is **not** lock contention.

#### ENUM tables: do not use `value`

[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#enum-tables-do-not-use-value)

All `ENUM_*`

tables have columns `id`

, `name`

, `label`

– there is **no** `value`

**column**. Filtering by `b.value = '…'`

fails with a SQLite column error:

```
-- Right
JOIN ENUM_SCHEDULING_THREAD_BLOCK b ON se.threadBlock = b.id
WHERE b.name = 'Resource'
-- Wrong (no `value` column)
JOIN ENUM_SCHEDULING_THREAD_BLOCK b ON se.threadBlock = b.id
WHERE b.value = 'Resource'
```

#### cpuCycles attribution[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#cpucycles-attribution)

**Always filter** `cpuCycles = 1`

when attributing CPU time.
`cpuCycles`

is the value of the `CpuCycles`

PMU event carried by a composite event: a periodic CPU-cycle sample is tagged with value `1`

, and any callstack captured for another reason (a scheduling / context-switch transition) carries no such event and exports as `0`

.
This holds on both Linux and Windows. On Linux, only `PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE`

records are stamped `CpuCycles=1`

(context-switch records become `SCHED_EVENTS`

), and on Windows only single-frame stackwalks bearing a `CpuCycles`

event count as samples (CSwitch / ReadyThread stackwalks do not).
Including `cpuCycles = 0`

therefore distorts hotspot results by over-counting functions that coincide with frequent scheduling events. `cpuCycles = 0`

callstacks are non-sample (scheduling-event) stacks – they belong with scheduling-event analysis (wake / block reasons), not with hotspot identification. Equivalently, weight by `SUM(cpuCycles)`

, which counts non-samples as `0`

(this is what the shipped flat / bottom-up views do).

##### No periodic CPU samples in the capture[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#no-periodic-cpu-samples-in-the-capture)

If periodic CPU-cycle sampling was not enabled for the capture, then such samples will not be collected – a count of 0 samples is then a data-absence artifact, **not** confirmation of inactivity.

### Graphics Schema Pitfalls[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#graphics-schema-pitfalls)

Common SQL traps and misinterpretations when querying graphics-related tables in
the `.sqlite`

database produced by `nsys export`

. Read these alongside the
[SQLite Schema Reference](https://docs.nvidia.com#sqlite-schema) (table columns, ID encoding, timestamps, and query patterns)
and the [SQLite Schema Pitfalls](https://docs.nvidia.com#sqlite-schema-pitfalls) section.

#### ETW_EVENTS gotchas (Windows traces)[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#etw-events-gotchas-windows-traces)

Columns are

`timestamp`

,`typeId`

,`globalTid`

,`opcode`

,`data`

.**No**`duration`

**column**– ETW events are point-in-time, not intervals.Event names go through

`GENERIC_EVENT_TYPES.nameId`

->`StringIds.value`

. Always join; comparing`nameId`

against a string literal silently matches nothing.`etwEventId`

is**not**a column on`ETW_EVENTS`

– it lives on`GENERIC_EVENT_TYPES`

(the event-*type*metadata), reached via the same`ETW_EVENTS.typeId`

->`GENERIC_EVENT_TYPES.typeId`

join as above. To filter by event id, join through the type table (`WHERE t.etwEventId = 184`

), never`WHERE etwEventId = 184`

directly on`ETW_EVENTS`

.DxgKrnl

`Present`

events are the event type with`etwEventId = 184`

(the canonical CPU frame boundary on Windows). Other`Present`

IDs (42 / 43) appear too – de-duplicate by sticking to 184 for frame counting.

#### DX12_API / VULKAN_API / OPENGL_API gotchas[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#dx12-api-vulkan-api-opengl-api-gotchas)

Columns are

`start`

,`end`

,`globalTid`

,`nameId`

.**Duration =**`(end - start)`

. Use`start`

/`end`

,**not**`timestamp`

– there is no`timestamp`

column.API name goes through

`StringIds.value`

. Always join.
