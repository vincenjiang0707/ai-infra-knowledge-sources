##
1.1. Introduction[](https://docs.nvidia.com#introduction)

Azure IoT Edge For Linux on Windows, otherwise referred to as EFLOW, is a Microsoft Technology for the deployment of Linux AI containers on Windows Edge devices. This document details how NVIDIA® CUDA® and NVIDIA GPU accelerated cloud native applications can be deployed on such EFLOW-enabled Windows devices.

EFLOW has the following components:


The Windows host OS with virtualization enabled

A Linux virtual machine

IoT Edge Runtime

IoT Edge Modules, or otherwise any docker-compatible containerized application (runs on moby/containerd)


GPU-accelerated IoT Edge Modules support for GeForce RTX GPUs is based on the GPU Paravirtualization that was foundational to CUDA on Windows Subsystem on Linux. So CUDA and compute support for EFLOW comes by virtue of existing CUDA support on WSL 2.

CUDA on WSL 2 boosted the productivity of CUDA developers by enabling them to build, develop, and containerize GPU accelerated NVIDIA AI/ML Linux applications on Windows desktop computers before deployment on Linux instances on the cloud. But EFLOW is aimed at deployment for AI at the edge. A containerized NVIDIA GPU accelerated Linux application that is either hosted on Azure IoT Hub or NGC registry can be seamlessly deployed at the edge such as a retail service center or hospitals. These edge deployments are typically IT managed devices entrenched with Windows devices for manageability but the advent of AI/ML use cases in this space seek the convergence for Linux and Windows applications not only to coexist but also seamlessly communicate on the same device.

Because CUDA support on EFLOW is predominantly based on WSL 2, refer to the Software Support, Limitations and Known Issues sections in the CUDA on WSL 2 document to stay abreast of the scope of NVIDIA software support available on EFLOW as well. Any additional prerequisites for EFLOW are covered in this document.

The following sections details installation of EFLOW, prerequisites for out-of-the-box CUDA support, followed by sample instructions for running an existing GPU accelerated container on EFLOW.

##
1.2. Setup and Installation[](https://docs.nvidia.com#setup-and-installation)

Follow the Microsoft EFLOW documentation page for various installation options suiting your needs:


For up-to-date installation instructions, visit

[http://aka.ms/AzEFLOW-install].For details on the EFLOW PowerShell API, visit

[http://aka.ms/AzEFLOW-PowerShell].

For quick setup, we have included the steps for installation through Powershell in the following sections.

###
1.2.1. Driver Installation[](https://docs.nvidia.com#driver-installation)

On the target Windows device, first install an NVIDIA GeForce or NVIDIA RTX GPU Windows driver that is compatible with the NVIDIA GPU on your device. EFLOW VM supports deploying containerized CUDA applications and hence only the driver must be installed on the host system. CUDA Toolkit cannot be installed directly within EFLOW.

NVIDIA-provided CUDA containers from the NGC registry can be deployed directly. If you are preparing a CUDA docker container, ensure that the necessary toolchains are installed.

Because EFLOW is based on WSL, the restrictions of the software stack for a hybrid Linux on Windows environment apply, and not all of the NVIDIA software stack is supported. Refer to the user’s guide of the SDK that you are interested in to determine support.

###
1.2.2. Installation of EFLOW[](https://docs.nvidia.com#installation-of-eflow)

In an elevated powershell prompt perform the following:

-
**Enable HyperV.**Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -AllPath : Online : True RestartNeeded : False

-
**Set execution policy and verify.**Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Force Get-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned

-
**Download and install EFLOW.**$msiPath = $([io.Path]::Combine($env:TEMP, 'AzureIoTEdge.msi')) $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue' Invoke-WebRequest "https://aka.ms/AzEFLOWMSI_1_4_LTS_X64" -OutFile $msiPath Start-Process -Wait msiexec -ArgumentList "/i","$([io.Path]::Combine($env:TEMP, 'AzureIoTEdge.msi'))","/qn"

-
**Determine host OS configuration.**>Get-EflowHostConfiguration | format-list FreePhysicalMemoryInMB : 35502 NumberOfLogicalProcessors : {64, 64} DiskInfo : @{Drive=C:; FreeSizeInGB=798} GpuInfo : @{Count=1; SupportedPassthroughTypes=System.Object[]; Name=NVIDIA RTX A2000}

-
**Deploy EFLOW.**Deploying EFLOW will set up the EFLOW runtime and virtual machine.

By default, EFLOW only reserves 1024MB of system memory for use for the workloads and that is insufficient to support GPU accelerated configurations. For GPU acceleration, you will have to reserve system memory explicitly at EFLOW deployment; otherwise there will not be sufficient system memory for your containerized applications to run. In order to prevent out of memory errors, reserve memory explicitly as required; see example below. (Refer to command line argument options available for deploying EFLOW in the official documentation for more details).


###
1.2.3. Prerequisites for CUDA Support[](https://docs.nvidia.com#prerequisites-for-cuda-support)

x86 64-bit support only.

GeForce RTX GPU products.

Windows 10/11 (Pro, Enterprise, IoT Enterprise) - Windows 10 users must use the November 2021 update build 19044.1620 or higher.

Deploy-Eflow only allocates 1024 MB memory by default, set it to a larger value to prevent OOM issue, check MS documents for more details at

[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/reference-iot-edge-for-linux-on-windows-functions#deploy-eflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/reference-iot-edge-for-linux-on-windows-functions#deploy-eflow).

Other prerequisites specific to the platform also apply. Refer to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/gpu-acceleration?view=iotedge-1.4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/gpu-acceleration?view=iotedge-1.4).

1.6. Troubleshooting[](https://docs.nvidia.com#troubleshooting)

**nvidia-container-cli: requirement error: unsatisfied condition: cuda>=11.7”, need add “–env NVIDIA_DISABLE_REQUIRE=1”**

The CUDA version cannot be determined correctly from the driver on the host when launching the container.

**Out of memory**

In case of out of memory errors, increase the system memory reserved by EFLOW. Refer to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/reference-iot-edge-for-linux-on-windows-functions#deploy-eflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/reference-iot-edge-for-linux-on-windows-functions#deploy-eflow).
