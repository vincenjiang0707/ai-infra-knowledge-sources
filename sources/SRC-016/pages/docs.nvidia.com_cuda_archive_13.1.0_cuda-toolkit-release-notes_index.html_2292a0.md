## 2.2. CUDA Driver[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-driver)

Running a CUDA application requires the system with at least one CUDA capable GPU and a driver that is compatible with the CUDA Toolkit. See

[Table 3]. For more information various GPU products that are CUDA capable, visit[https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus].Each release of the CUDA Toolkit requires a minimum version of the CUDA driver. The CUDA driver is backward compatible, meaning that applications compiled against a particular version of the CUDA will continue to work on subsequent (later) driver releases.

More information on compatibility can be found at

[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#cuda-compatibility-and-upgrades].

Note: Starting with CUDA 11.0, the toolkit components are individually versioned, and the toolkit itself is versioned as shown in the table below.The minimum required driver version for CUDA minor version compatibility is shown below. CUDA minor version compatibility is described in detail in

[https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html]

CTK Version |
Driver Range for Minor Version Compatibility |
|
|---|---|---|
Min |
Max |
|
13.x |
>= 580 |
N/A |
12.x |
>= 525 |
< 580 |
11.x |
>= 450 |
< 525 |

* Using a Minimum Required Version that is **different** from Toolkit Driver Version could be allowed in compatibility mode – please read the CUDA Compatibility Guide for details.

** Starting with CUDA 13.1, the Windows display driver is **no longer** bundled with the CUDA Toolkit package. Users must download and install the appropriate NVIDIA driver separately from the official driver download page.

For more information on supported driver versions, see the [CUDA Compatibility Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html) for drivers.

*** CUDA 11.0 was released with an earlier driver version, but by upgrading to Tesla Recommended Drivers 450.80.02 (Linux) / 452.39 (Windows), minor version compatibility is possible across the CUDA 11.x family of toolkits.

The version of the development NVIDIA GPU Driver packaged in each CUDA Toolkit release is shown below.

CUDA Toolkit driver bundling (pre-CUDA 13.1):

The CUDA Toolkit previously included an NVIDIA display driver for convenience.

This bundled driver was intended only for development purposes.

It is not recommended for production use, especially with Tesla GPUs.


Recommended driver for Tesla GPUs:

For production environments using Tesla GPUs, download the latest certified driver from the official NVIDIA Driver Downloads site:


Optional driver installation during Toolkit setup:

During CUDA Toolkit installation, users may choose to skip driver installation:

On Windows: via interactive or silent install options.

On Linux: by skipping driver meta packages.



Change in CUDA 13.1 (Windows-specific):

Starting with CUDA 13.1, the Windows display driver is

**no longer bundled**with the CUDA Toolkit.Windows users must

**manually download and install**the appropriate driver from the official NVIDIA site.

Driver compatibility notes:

Some compatibility tables may list “N/A” for Windows driver versions.

Users must still ensure the installed driver meets or exceeds the minimum required version for the CUDA Toolkit.

For details, refer to the official CUDA Compatibility Guide for Drivers:



## 2.3. New Features[](https://docs.nvidia.com#new-features)

### 2.3.1. General CUDA[](https://docs.nvidia.com#id2)

Introducing

**CUDA Tile**(CUDA Tile IR and`cuTile`

)CUDA 13.1 introduces CUDA Tile, which comprises CUDA Tile IR, a new virtual instruction set for NVIDIA GPUs that enables high-performance, tile-based code generation at a higher level of abstraction.

Building on this,

`cuTile`

is a new Python domain-specific language (DSL) that allows developers to author these high-performance, tile-based GPU kernels.CUDA Tile includes updates across the compiler pipeline, FATBIN format, and driver.

The initial release targets Blackwell GPUs, with broader architecture support planned across the CUDA 13.x series.


For a high-level overview, see the

[CUDA Tile webpage](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/tile). For IR and compiler details, see the[CUDA Tile IR documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/tile-ir/), and for the Python front end, see the[cuTile Python documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cutile-python/).`CU_MEMCPY_FLAG_PREFER_OVERLAP_WITH_COMPUTE`

/`cudaMemcpyFlagPreferOverlapWithCompute`

is now supported on non-Tegra platforms for the batched memcpy APIs: when set, the driver favors Copy Engines to overlap transfers with compute and keep SMs free (previously Tegra-only). Final engine selection depends on the platform and transfer.


### 2.3.2. CUDA Compiler[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-compiler)

For changes to PTX, see the

[PTX ISA version 9.1 documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#ptx-isa-version-9-1).CUDA 13.1 introduces

`tileiras`

, a compiler that translates Tile IR bytecode into GPU machine instructions (SASS). For more information, see the[Tile IR specification and changelog](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/tile-ir/).

### 2.3.3. CUDA Documentation[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-documentation)

Introduced the new

[CUDA Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/index.html), the official, comprehensive resource on the CUDA programming model. The guide has been restructured into five parts that cover a language agnostic overview of CUDA, introductory and advanced CUDA programming in C++ and Python, detailed descriptions of specific CUDA features, and technical appendices for reference. The[legacy CUDA C++ Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html)remains available in this release but is deprecated and includes notices that direct readers to the new guide.

### 2.3.4. CUDA Developer Tools[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-developer-tools)

For details on new features, improvements, and bug fixes, see the changelogs for:

## 2.4. Known Issues[](https://docs.nvidia.com#known-issues)

### 2.4.1. General CUDA[](https://docs.nvidia.com#id3)

Certain Linux kernels with KASLR enabled have a known issue in HMM initialization, causing CUDA initialization to fail. This issue is indicated by the following debug message:


[64689.125237] nvidia-uvm: uvm_pmm_gpu.c:3176 devmem_alloc_pagemap[pid:92821] request_free_mem_region() err -34Fixes to this issue are being handled in upstream kernels. In the meantime, you can use one of the following workarounds:


Option 1: Disable KASLR (Preferred option)

If using GRUB, edit /etc/default/grub and add

`nokaslr`

to`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`

:GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nokaslr"Then, update GRUB and reboot:

sudo update-grub sudo rebootOption 2: Disable HMM for UVM


Create or edit /etc/modprobe.d/uvm.conf.

Add or update the following line:

options nvidia_uvm uvm_disable_hmm=1Unload and reload the

`nvidia_uvm`

kernel module or reboot the system:sudo modprobe -r nvidia_uvm sudo modprobe nvidia_uvm

### 2.4.2. CUDA Compiler[](https://docs.nvidia.com#id4)

The Tile-IR AS compiler currently supports only Blackwell-class devices and has limited low-precision support. These limitations will be removed in a future release.


## 2.5. Deprecated or Dropped Features[](https://docs.nvidia.com#deprecated-or-dropped-features)

### 2.5.1. General CUDA[](https://docs.nvidia.com#id5)

CUDA 13.0 deprecates the following legacy vector types:

`double4`

`long4`

`ulong4`

`longlong4`

`ulonglong4`


These types are being replaced by new aligned variants:

`*_16a`

and`*_32a`

(e.g.,`double4_16a`

,`double4_32a`

)

Deprecation warnings can be managed as follows:

Globally silenced by defining

`__NV_NO_VECTOR_DEPRECATION_DIAG`

Locally suppressed using the macro pair

`__NV_SILENCE_HOST_DEPRECATION_BEGIN`

/`__NV_SILENCE_HOST_DEPRECATION_END`


These legacy types are planned for removal in CUDA 14.0.

The

**CUDA installer**for Windows**no longer**bundles the display driver. Users must install the display driver separately, either before or after installing the CUDA Toolkit.**Multi-device launch APIs**and related references for Cooperative Groups**have been removed**. These APIs were previously marked as deprecated in CUDA 12.x:`cudaLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`

has been removed from`cuda_runtime_api.h`

.The accompanying parameter struct

`cudaLaunchParam`

has been removed from`driver_types.h`

.`this_multi_grid`

and`multi_grid_group`

have been removed from`cooperative_groups.h`

.

**Changes to cudaDeviceProperties structure**:In CUDA 13.0, several deprecated fields have been removed from the

`cudaDeviceProperties`

structure. To ensure forward compatibility, use the recommended replacement APIs listed below:**Removed Fields and Their Replacements****Removed Field****Replacement API**clockRate

`cudaDeviceGetAttribute(cudaDevAttrClockRate)`

deviceOverlap

Use the

`asyncEngineCount`

fieldkernelExecTimeoutEnabled

`cudaDeviceGetAttribute(cudaDevAttrKernelExecTimeout)`

computeMode

`cudaDeviceGetAttribute(cudaDevAttrComputeMode)`

maxTexture1DLinear

`cudaDeviceGetTexture1DLinearMaxWidth()`

memoryClockRate

`cudaDeviceGetAttribute(cudaDevAttrMemoryClockRate)`

singleToDoublePrecisionPerfRatio

`cudaDeviceGetAttribute(cudaDevAttrSingleToDoublePrecisionPerfRatio)`

cooperativeMultiDeviceLaunch

*No replacement available***Removed cudaDeviceAttr Types (No Replacement Available)**`cudaDevAttrCooperativeMultiDeviceLaunch`

`cudaDevAttrMaxTimelineSemaphoreInteropSupported`


The following legacy header files related to deprecated texture and surface references have been removed from the CUDA 13.0 runtime:

cuda_surface_types.h

cuda_texture_types.h

surface_functions.h

texture_fetch_functions.h



### 2.5.2. Deprecated Architectures[](https://docs.nvidia.com#deprecated-architectures)

Architecture support for Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta is considered feature-complete. Offline compilation and library support for these architectures have been removed in CUDA Toolkit 13.0 major version release. The use of CUDA Toolkits through the 12.x series to build applications for these architectures will continue to be supported, but newer toolkits will be unable to target these architectures.


### 2.5.3. Deprecated or Dropped Operating Systems[](https://docs.nvidia.com#deprecated-or-dropped-operating-systems)

Support for Ubuntu 20.04 has been dropped starting with this release. Users are advised to migrate to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later.


### 2.5.4. Deprecated or Dropped CUDA Toolchains[](https://docs.nvidia.com#deprecated-or-dropped-cuda-toolchains)

**CUDA Tools**

As of CUDA 13.1, support for Nsight Eclipse Edition plugins is deprecated, and will be dropped in a future CUDA release.


# 3. CUDA Libraries[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-libraries)

This section covers CUDA Libraries release notes for 13.x releases.

Note

Documentation will be updated to accurately reflect supported C++ standard libraries for CUDA Math Libraries.

## 3.1. cuBLAS Library[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cublas-library)

### 3.1.1. cuBLAS: Release 13.1[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cublas-release-13-1)

**New Features**Introduced experimental support for grouped GEMM in cuBLASLt. Users can create a matrix with grouped layout using

`cublasLtGroupedMatrixLayoutCreate`

or`cublasLtGroupedMatrixLayoutInit`

, where matrix shapes are passed as device arrays.`cublasLtMatmul`

now accepts matrices with grouped layout, in which case matrices are passed as a device array of pointers, where each pointer is a separate matrix that represents a group with its own shapes. Initial support covers A/B types FP8 (E4M3/E5M2), FP16, and BF16, with C/D types FP16, BF16, and FP32; column-major only, default epilogue, 16-byte alignment; requires GPUs with compute capability 10.x or 11.0.In addition, the following experimental features were added as part of grouped GEMM:

Per-batch tensor-wide scaling for FP8 inputs, enabled by the new

`cublasLtMatmulDescAttributes_t`

entry`CUBLASLT_MATMUL_MATRIX_SCALE_PER_BATCH_SCALAR_32F`

.Per-batch device-side alpha and beta, enabled by the new

`cublasLtMatmulDescAttributes_t`

entries`CUBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_ALPHA_BATCH_STRIDE`

and`CUBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_BETA_BATCH_STRIDE`

.

Improved performance on NVIDIA DGX Spark for CFP32 GEMMs. [

*5514146*]Added SM121 DriveOS support.

Improved performance on Blackwell (

`sm_100`

and`sm_103`

) via heuristics tuning for FP32 GEMMs whose shapes satisfy`M, N >> K`

. [*CUB-8572*]Improved performance of FP16, FP32, and CFP32 GEMMs on Blackwell Thor.


**Resolved Issues**Fixed missing memory initialization in

`cublasCreate()`

that could result in emulation environment variables being ignored. [*CUB-9302*]Removed unnecessary overhead related to loading kernels on GPUs with compute capability 10.3. [

*5547886*]Fixed FP8 matmuls potentially failing to launch on multi-device Blackwell GeForce systems. [

*CUB-9487*]Added stricter checks for in-place matmul to prevent invalid use cases (

`C == D`

is allowed if and only if`Cdesc == Ddesc`

). As a side effect, users are no longer able to use`D`

as a dummy pointer for`C`

when using`CUBLASLT_POINTER_MODE_DEVICE`

with`beta = 0`

. However, a distinct dummy pointer may still be passed. The stricter checking was added in CUDA Toolkit 13.0 Update 2. [*5471880*]Fixed

`cublasLtMatmul`

with`INT8`

inputs,`INT32`

accumulation, and`INT32`

outputs potentially returning`CUBLAS_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED`

when dimension`N`

is larger than 65,536 or when batch count is larger than 1. [*5541380*]

**Known Issues**The

`Grouped GEMM`

cuBLASLt API ignores groups with`k = 0`

, which can lead to incorrect results. As a workaround, initialize each output matrix`D`

with`beta * C`

for all groups before the call, then compute Grouped GEMM as`D += A * B`

so that the result for groups with`k = 0`

is preserved. This issue applies to the experimental Grouped GEMM cuBLASLt API released in CUDA 13.1. [*CUB-9529*]


### 3.1.2. cuBLAS: Release 13.0 Update 2[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cublas-release-13-0-update-2)

**New Features**Enabled opt-in fixed-point emulation for FP64 matmuls (D/ZGEMM) which improves performance and power-efficiency. The implementation follows the

[Ozaki-1 Scheme](https://doi.org/10.1177/10943420241239588)and leverages an automatic dynamic precision framework to ensure FP64-level accuracy. See[here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublas/index.html#fixed-point)for more details on fixed-point emulation along with the[table](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublas/index.html#floating-point-emulation-support-overview)of supported compute-capabilities and the[CUDA library samples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/CUDALibrarySamples/tree/master/cuBLAS/Emulation)for example usages.Improved performance on NVIDIA

[DGX Spark](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/)for FP16/BF16 and FP8 GEMMs.Added support for

[BF16x9 FP32 emulation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublas/#bf16x9)to`cublas[SC]syr[2]k`

and`cublasCher[2]k`

routines. With the math mode set to`CUBLAS_FP32_EMULATED_BF16X9_MATH`

, for large enough problems, cuBLAS will automatically dispatch SYRK and HERK to BF16x9-accelerated algorithms.

**Resolved Issues**Fixed undefined behavior caused by dereferencing a

`nullptr`

when passing an uninitialized matrix layout descriptor for`Cdesc`

in`cublasLtMatmul`

. [*CUB-8911*]Improved performance of

`cublas[SCDZ]syr[2]k`

and`cublas[CZ]her[2]k`

on Hopper GPUs when dimension`N`

is large. [*CUB-8293*,*5384826*]

**Known Issues**`cublasLtMatmul`

with INT8 inputs, INT32 accumulation, and INT32 outputs might return`CUBLAS_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED`

when dimension`N`

is larger than 65,536 or when the batch count is larger than 1. The issue has existed since CUDA Toolkit 13.0 Update 1 and will be fixed in a later release. [*5541380*]


### 3.1.3. cuBLAS: Release 13.0 Update 1[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cublas-release-13-0-update-1)

**New Features**Improved performance:

Block-scaled FP4 GEMMs on NVIDIA Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs

`SYMV`

on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs [*5171345*]`cublasLtMatmul`

for small cases when run concurrently with other CUDA kernels [*5238629*]TF32 GEMMs on Thor GPUs [

*5313616*][Programmatic Dependent Launch (PDL)](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/#programmatic-dependent-launch-and-synchronization)is now supported in some cuBLAS kernels for architectures`sm_90`

and above, decreasing kernel launch latencies when executed alongside other PDL kernels.


**Resolved Issues**Fixed an issue where some

`cublasSsyrkx`

kernels produced incorrect results when`beta = 0`

on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs. [*CUB-8846*]Resolved issues in

`cublasLtMatmul`

with INT8 inputs, INT32 accumulation, and INT32 outputs where:`cublasLtMatmul`

could have produced incorrect results when A and B matrices used regular ordering (CUBLASLT_ORDER_COL or CUBLASLT_ORDER_ROW). [*CUB-8874*]`cublasLtMatmul`

could have been run with unsupported configurations of`alpha`

/`beta`

, which must be 0 or 1. [*CUB-8873*]



### 3.1.4. cuBLAS: Release 13.0[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cublas-release-13-0)

**New Features**The

`cublasGemmEx`

,`cublasGemmBatchedEx`

, and`cublasGemmStridedBatchedEx`

functions now accept`CUBLAS_GEMM_AUTOTUNE`

as a valid value for the`algo`

parameter. When this option is used, the library benchmarks a selection of available algorithms internally and chooses the optimal one based on the given problem configuration. The selected algorithm is cached within the current`cublasHandle_t`

, so subsequent calls with the same problem descriptor will reuse the cached configuration for improved performance.This is an experimental feature. Users are encouraged to transition to the cuBLASLt API, which provides fine-grained control over algorithm selection through the heuristics API and includes support for additional data types such as FP8 and block-scaled formats, as well as kernel fusion. (see autotuning example in

[cuBLASLt](https://github.com/NVIDIA/CUDALibrarySamples/tree/master/cuBLASLt/LtSgemmSimpleAutoTuning)).Improved performance of BLAS Level 3 non-GEMM kernels (SYRK, HERK, TRMM, SYMM, HEMM) for FP32 and CF32 precisions on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs.

This release adds support of SM110 GPUs for arm64-sbsa on Linux.


**Known Issues**`cublasLtMatmul`

previously ignored user-specified auxiliary (Aux) data types for ReLU epilogues and defaulted to using a bitmask. The correct behavior is now enforced: an error is returned if an invalid Aux data type is specified for ReLU epilogues.*[CUB-7984]*

**Deprecations**The experimental feature for atomic synchronization along the rows (

`CUBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_ATOMIC_SYNC_NUM_CHUNKS_D_ROWS`

) and columns (`CUBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_ATOMIC_SYNC_NUM_CHUNKS_D_COLS`

) of the output matrix which was deprecated in 12.8 has now been**removed**.Starting with this release, cuBLAS will return

`CUBLAS_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED`

if any of the following descriptor attributes are set but the corresponding scale is not supported:`CUBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_A_SCALE_POINTER`

`CUBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_B_SCALE_POINTER`

`CUBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_D_SCALE_POINTER`

`CUBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_D_OUT_SCALE_POINTER`

`CUBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_EPILOGUE_AUX_SCALE_POINTER`


Previously, this restriction applied only to

[non-narrow precision](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublas/#narrow-precision-data-types-usage)matmuls. It now also applies to narrow precision matmuls when a scale is set for a non-narrow precision tensor.

, a value that can be assigned to a`cufftHandle`

to indicate a null handle. It is safe to call`cufftDestroy`

on a null handle.Improved performance for single-precision C2C multi-dimensional FFTs and large power-of-2 FFTs.


**Known Issues**An issue identified in CUDA 13.0 affects the correctness of a specific subset of cuFFT kernels, specifically half-precision and bfloat16 size-1 strided R2C and C2R transforms. A fix will be included in a future CUDA release.


**Deprecations**Removed support for Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPUs, corresponding to compute capabilities earlier than Turing.

Removed legacy cuFFT error codes:

`CUFFT_INCOMPLETE_PARAMETER_LIST`

`CUFFT_PARSE_ERROR`

`CUFFT_LICENSE_ERROR`


Removed the

`libcufft../_static_nocallback.a`

static library. Users should link against`libcufft../_static.a`

instead, as both are functionally equivalent.
