CUDA-GDB

The user manual for CUDA-GDB, the NVIDIA tool for debugging CUDA applications on Linux and QNX systems.

#
1. Introduction[](https://docs.nvidia.com#introduction)

This document introduces CUDA-GDB, the NVIDIA® CUDA® debugger for Linux and QNX targets.

##
1.1. What is CUDA-GDB?[](https://docs.nvidia.com#what-is-cuda-gdb)

CUDA-GDB is the NVIDIA tool for debugging CUDA applications running on Linux and QNX. CUDA-GDB is an extension to GDB, the GNU Project debugger. The tool provides developers with a mechanism for debugging CUDA applications running on actual hardware. This enables developers to debug applications without the potential variations introduced by simulation and emulation environments.

##
1.2. Supported Features[](https://docs.nvidia.com#supported-features)

CUDA-GDB is designed to present the user with a seamless debugging environment that allows simultaneous debugging of both GPU and CPU code within the same application. Just as programming in CUDA C is an extension to C programming, debugging with CUDA-GDB is a natural extension to debugging with GDB. The existing GDB debugging features are inherently present for debugging the host code, and additional features have been provided to support debugging CUDA device code.

CUDA-GDB supports debugging C/C++ and Fortran CUDA applications. Fortran debugging support is limited to 64-bit Linux operating system.

CUDA-GDB allows the user to set breakpoints, to single-step CUDA applications, and also to inspect and modify the memory and variables of any given thread running on the hardware.

CUDA-GDB supports debugging all CUDA applications, whether they use the CUDA driver API, the CUDA runtime API, or both.

CUDA-GDB supports debugging kernels that have been compiled for specific CUDA architectures, such as `sm_75`

or `sm_80`

, but also supports debugging kernels compiled at runtime, referred to as just-in-time compilation, or JIT compilation for short.

##
1.3. About This Document[](https://docs.nvidia.com#about-this-document)

This document is the main documentation for CUDA-GDB and is organized more as a user manual than a reference manual. The rest of the document will describe how to install and use CUDA-GDB to debug CUDA kernels and how to use the new CUDA commands that have been added to GDB. Some walk-through examples are also provided. It is assumed that the user already knows the basic GDB commands used to debug host applications.

CUDA-GDB supports CUDA Fortran debugging on 64-bit Linux operating systems.


- GDB 7.6.2 Code Base
-
The code base for CUDA-GDB was upgraded to GDB 7.6.2.



**6.0 Release**

- Unified Memory Support
-
Managed variables can be read and written from either a host thread or a device thread. The debugger also annotates memory addresses that reside in managed memory with

`@managed`

. The list of statically allocated managed variables can be accessed through a new`info cuda managed`

command.

- GDB 7.6 Code Base
-
The code base for CUDA-GDB was upgraded from GDB 7.2 to GDB 7.6.


- Android Support
-
CUDA-GDB can now be used to debug Android native applications either locally or remotely.


- Single-Stepping Optimizations
-
CUDA-GDB can now use optimized methods to single-step the program, which accelerate single-stepping most of the time. This feature can be disabled by issuing

`set cuda single_stepping_optimizations off`

.

- Faster Remote Debugging
-
A lot of effort has gone into making remote debugging considerably faster, up to 2 orders of magnitude. The effort also made local debugging faster.


- Kernel Entry Breakpoints
-
The

`set cuda break_on_launch`

option will now break on kernels launched from the GPU. Also, enabling this option does not affect kernel launch notifications.

- Precise Error Attribution
-
On Maxwell architecture (SM 5.0), the instruction that triggers an exception will be reported accurately. The application keeps making forward progress and the PC at which the debugger stops may not match that address but an extra output message identifies the origin of the exception.


- Live Range Optimizations
-
To mitigate the issue of variables not being accessible at some code addresses, the debugger offers two new options. With

`set cuda value_extrapolation`

, the latest known value is displayed with`(possibly)`

prefix. With`set cuda ptx_cache`

, the latest known value of the PTX register associated with a source variable is displayed with the`(cached)`

prefix.

- Event Notifications
-
Kernel event notifications are not displayed by default any more.

New kernel events verbosity options have been added:

`set cuda kernel_events`

,`set cuda kernel_events_depth`

. Also`set cuda defer_kernel_launch_notifications`

has been deprecated and has no effect any more.


**5.5 Release**

- Kernel Launch Trace
-
Two new commands,

`info cuda launch trace`

and`info cuda launch children`

, are introduced to display the kernel launch trace and the children kernel of a given kernel when Dynamic Parallelism is used.

- Single-GPU Debugging (BETA)
-
CUDA-GDB can now be used to debug a CUDA application on the same GPU that is rendering the desktop GUI. This feature also enables debugging of long-running or indefinite CUDA kernels that would otherwise encounter a launch timeout. In addition, multiple CUDA-GDB sessions can debug CUDA applications context-switching on the same GPU. This feature is available on Linux with SM3.5 devices.


- Remote GPU Debugging
-
CUDA-GDB in conjunction with CUDA-GDBSERVER can now be used to debug a CUDA application running on the remote host.



**5.0 Release**

- Dynamic Parallelism Support
-
CUDA-GDB fully supports Dynamic Parallelism, a new feature introduced with the 5.0 toolkit. The debugger is able to track the kernels launched from another kernel and to inspect and modify variables like any other CPU-launched kernel.


- Attach/Detach
-
It is now possible to attach to a CUDA application that is already running. It is also possible to detach from the application before letting it run to completion. When attached, all the usual features of the debugger are available to the user, as if the application had been launched from the debugger. This feature is also supported with applications using Dynamic Parallelism.


- Attach on exception
-
Using the environment variable

`CUDA_DEVICE_WAITS_ON_EXCEPTION`

, the application will run normally until a device exception occurs. Then the application will wait for the debugger to attach itself to it for further debugging.

- API Error Reporting
-
Checking the error code of all the CUDA driver API and CUDA runtime API function calls is vital to ensure the correctness of a CUDA application. Now the debugger is able to report, and even stop, when any API call returns an error. See

`set cuda api_failures`

for more information.

- Inlined Subroutine Support
-
Inlined subroutines are now accessible from the debugger on SM 2.0 and above. The user can inspect the local variables of those subroutines and visit the call frame stack as if the routines were not inlined.



**4.2 Release**

- Kepler Support
-
The primary change in Release 4.2 of CUDA-GDB is the addition of support for the new Kepler architecture. There are no other user-visible changes in this release.

-
Until now, CUDA-GDB was based on GDB 6.6 on Linux, and GDB 6.3.5 on Darwin (the Apple branch). Now, both versions of CUDA-GDB are using the same 7.2 source base.

Now CUDA-GDB supports newer versions of GCC (tested up to GCC 4.5), has better support for DWARF3 debug information, and better C++ debugging support.


- Simultaneous Sessions Support
-
With the 4.1 release, the single CUDA-GDB process restriction is lifted. Now, multiple CUDA-GDB sessions are allowed to co-exist as long as the GPUs are not shared between the applications being processed. For instance, one CUDA-GDB process can debug process foo using GPU 0 while another CUDA-GDB process debugs process bar using GPU 1. The exclusive of GPUs can be enforced with the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable.


- New Autostep Command
-
A new ‘autostep’ command was added. The command increases the precision of CUDA exceptions by automatically single-stepping through portions of code.

Under normal execution, the thread and instruction where an exception occurred may be imprecisely reported. However, the exact instruction that generates the exception can be determined if the program is being single-stepped when the exception occurs.

Manually single-stepping through a program is a slow and tedious process. Therefore ‘autostep’ aides the user by allowing them to specify sections of code where they suspect an exception could occur. These sections are automatically single-stepped through when the program is running, and any exception that occurs within these sections is precisely reported.

Type ‘help autostep’ from CUDA-GDB for the syntax and usage of the command.


- Multiple Context Support
-
On GPUs with compute capability of SM20 or higher, debugging multiple contexts on the same GPU is now supported. It was a known limitation until now.


- Device Assertions Support
-
The R285 driver released with the 4.1 version of the toolkit supports device assertions. CUDA_GDB supports the assertion call and stops the execution of the application when the assertion is hit. Then the variables and memory can be inspected as usual. The application can also be resumed past the assertion if needed. Use the ‘set cuda hide_internal_frames’ option to expose/hide the system call frames (hidden by default).


- Temporary Directory
-
By default, the debugger API will use /tmp as the directory to store temporary files. To select a different directory, the $TMPDIR environment variable and the API CUDBG_APICLIENT_PID variable must be set.



#
3. Getting Started[](https://docs.nvidia.com#getting-started)

The CUDA toolkit can be installed by following instructions in the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-quick-start-guide/).

Further steps should be taken to set up the debugger environment, build the application, and run the debugger.

##
3.1. Setting Up the Debugger Environment[](https://docs.nvidia.com#setting-up-the-debugger-environment)

###
3.1.1. Temporary Directory[](https://docs.nvidia.com#temporary-directory)

By default, CUDA-GDB uses `/tmp`

as the directory to store temporary files. To select a different directory, set the `$TMPDIR`

environment variable.

Note

The user must have write and execute permission to the temporary directory used by CUDA-GDB. Otherwise, the debugger will fail with an internal error.

Note

The value of `$TMPDIR`

must be the same in the environment of the application and CUDA-GDB. If they do not match, CUDA-GDB will fail to attach onto the application process.

###
3.1.2. Using the CUDA-GDB debugger on Jetson and Drive Tegra devices[](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-the-cuda-gdb-debugger-on-jetson-and-drive-tegra-devices)

By default, on Jetson and Drive Tegra devices, GPU debugging is supported only if `cuda-gdb`

and `cuda-gdbserver`

are launched by a user who is a member of the **debug** group.

To add the current user to the **debug** group run this command:

```
sudo usermod -a -G debug $USER
```

##
3.2. Compiling the Application[](https://docs.nvidia.com#compiling-the-application)

###
3.2.1. Debug Compilation[](https://docs.nvidia.com#debug-compilation)

NVCC, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler driver, provides a mechanism for generating the debugging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly. The `-g -G`

option pair must be passed to NVCC when an application is compiled for ease of debugging with CUDA-GDB; for example,

```
nvcc -g -G foo.cu -o foo
```

Using this line to compile the CUDA application `foo.cu`


forces

`-O0`

compilation, with the exception of very limited dead-code eliminations and register-spilling optimizations.makes the compiler include debug information in the executable


Note

Enabling the `-G`

option increases the binary size by including debug information and reduces performance due to the absence of compiler optimizations.

To compile your CUDA Fortran code with debgging information necessary for CUDA-GDB to work properly, pgfortran, the PGI CUDA Fortran compiler, must be invoked with `-g`

option. Also, for the ease of debugging and forward compatibility with the future GPU architectures, it is recommended to compile the code with `-Mcuda=nordc`

option; for example,

```
pgfortran -g -Mcuda=nordc foo.cuf -o foo
```

For more information about the available compilation flags, please consult the PGI compiler documentation.

###
3.2.2. Compilation With Linenumber Information[](https://docs.nvidia.com#compilation-with-linenumber-information)

Several enhancements were made to cuda-gdb’s support for debugging programs compiled with `-lineinfo`

but not with `-G`

. This is intended primarily for debugging programs built with OptiX/RTCore.

Note that `-lineinfo`

can be used when trying to debug optimized code. In this case, debugger stepping and breakpoint behavior may appear somewhat erratic.

The PC may jump forward and backward unexpectedly while stepping.

The user may step into code that has no linenumber information, leading to an inability to determine which source-file/linenumber the code at the PC belongs to.

Breakpoints may break on a different line than they were originally set on.


When debugging OptiX/RTCore code, the following should be kept in mind:

NVIDIA internal code cannot be debugged or examined by the user.

OptiX/RTCode debugging is limited to

`-lineinfo`

, and building this code with full debug infomation (`-G`

) is not supported.OptiX/RTCode code is highly optimized, and as such the notes above about debugging optimized code apply.


###
3.2.3. Compilation With PTX Debug Option[](https://docs.nvidia.com#compilation-with-ptx-debug-option)

Using `-Xptxas`

nvcc option, `--make-errors-visible-at-exit`

can be used for error detection.

```
--make-errors-visible-at-exit (-make-errors-visible-at-exit)
Generate required instructions at exit point to make memory faults and errors visible at exit.
```

Note

Extra instructions generated by this flag can reduce application performance.

###
3.2.4. Compiling For Specific GPU architectures[](https://docs.nvidia.com#compiling-for-specific-gpu-architectures)

By default, the compiler will only generate code for the compute_75 PTX and sm_75 cubins. For later GPUs, the kernels are recompiled at runtime from the PTX for the architecture of the target GPU(s). Compiling for a specific virtual architecture guarantees that the application will work for any GPU architecture after that, for a trade-off in performance. This is done for forward-compatibility.

It is highly recommended to compile the application once and for all for the GPU architectures targeted by the application, and to generate the PTX code for the latest virtual architecture for forward compatibility.

A GPU architecture is defined by its compute capability. Click [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) to view the list of GPUs and their respective compute capability. The same application can be compiled for multiple GPU architectures. Use the `-gencode`

compilation option to dictate which GPU architecture to compile for. The option can be specified multiple times.

For instance, to compile an application for a GPU with compute capability 8.0, add the following flag to the compilation command:

```
-gencode arch=compute_80,code=sm_80
```

To compile PTX code for any future architecture past the compute capability 8.0 (See [virtual architectures](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/index.html#virtual-architectures)), add the following flag to the compilation command:

```
-gencode arch=compute_80,code=compute_80
```

For more information, refer to the compiler documentation [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/index.html#extended-notation).

###
3.2.5. Compiling with tensor memory checks[](https://docs.nvidia.com#compiling-with-tensor-memory-checks)

Starting with CUDA 12.8, the compiler can provide additional checks to catch invalid access errors by using the PTXAS flag `-g-tmem-access-check`

.

```
--g-tensor-memory-access-check (-g-tmem-access-check)
Enable tensor memory access checks for ``tcgen05`` operations.
```

For more information, refer to the compiler documentation [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/index.html#g-tensor-memory-access-check-g-tmem-access-check).

##
3.3. Using the Debugger[](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-the-debugger)

###
3.3.1. Multi-GPU Debugging[](https://docs.nvidia.com#multi-gpu-debugging)

Multi-GPU debugging designates the scenario where the application is running on more than one CUDA-capable device. Multi-GPU debugging is not much different than single-GPU debugging except for a few additional CUDA-GDB commands that let you switch between the GPUs.

Any GPU hitting a breakpoint will pause all the GPUs running CUDA on that system. Once paused, you can use `info cuda kernels`

to view all the active kernels and the GPUs they are running on. When any GPU is resumed, all the GPUs are resumed.

Note

If the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`

environment is used, only the specified devices are suspended and resumed.

All CUDA-capable GPUs may run one or more kernels. To switch to an active kernel, use `cuda kernel <n>`

, where `n`

is the ID of the kernel retrieved from `info cuda kernels`

.

Note

The same kernel can be loaded and used by different contexts and devices at the same time. When a breakpoint is set in such a kernel, by either name or file name and line number, it will be resolved arbitrarily to only one instance of that kernel. With the runtime API, the exact instance to which the breakpoint will be resolved cannot be controlled. With the driver API, the user can control the instance to which the breakpoint will be resolved to by setting the breakpoint *right after* its module is loaded.

###
3.3.2. Remote Debugging[](https://docs.nvidia.com#remote-debugging)

There are multiple methods to remote debug an application with CUDA-GDB. In addition to using SSH or VNC from the host system to connect to the target system, it is also possible to use the `target remote`

GDB feature. Using this option, the local `cuda-gdb`

(client) connects to the `cuda-gdbserver`

process (the server) running on the target system. This option is supported with a Linux client and a Linux or QNX server.

Setting remote debugging that way is a 2-step process:

**Launch the cuda-gdbserver on the remote host**

cuda-gdbserver can be launched on the remote host in different operation modes.

-
Option 1: Launch a new application in debug mode.

To launch a new application in debug mode, invoke cuda-gdb server as follows:

$ cuda-gdbserver :1234 app_invocation

Where

`1234`

is the TCP port number that`cuda-gdbserver`

will listen to for incoming connections from`cuda-gdb`

, and`app-invocation`

is the invocation command to launch the application, arguments included. -
Option 2: Attach

`cuda-gdbserver`

to the running processTo attach cuda-gdbserver to an already running process, the

`--attach`

option followed by process identification number (PID) must be used:$ cuda-gdbserver :1234 --attach 5678

Where

`1234`

is the TCP port number and`5678`

is process identifier of the application cuda-gdbserver must be attached to.

Note

Attaching to an already running process is not supported on QNX platforms.

**Launch cuda-gdb on the client**

Configure `cuda-gdb`

to connect to the remote target using either:

```
(cuda-gdb) target remote
```

or

```
(cuda-gdb) target extended-remote
```

Note

QNX platforms require setting the `QNX_TARGET`

environment variable to the location of the target rootfs. If this is not available on the client running `cuda-gdb`

, set it to an empty string.

It is recommended to use `set sysroot`

command if libraries installed on the debug target might differ from the ones installed on the debug host. For example, cuda-gdb could be configured to connect to remote target as follows:

```
(cuda-gdb) set sysroot remote://
(cuda-gdb) target remote 192.168.0.2:1234
```

Where `192.168.0.2`

is the IP address or domain name of the remote target, and `1234`

is the TCP port previously previously opened by `cuda-gdbserver`

.

###
3.3.3. Multiple Debuggers[](https://docs.nvidia.com#multiple-debuggers)

For devices with compute capability 6.0 and higher several debugging sessions may take place simultaneously.

For devices with compute capability less than 6.0, several debugging sessions may take place simultaneously as long as the CUDA devices are used exclusively. For instance, one instance of CUDA-GDB can debug a first application that uses the first GPU while another instance of CUDA-GDB debugs a second application that uses the second GPU. The exclusive use of a GPU is achieved by specifying which GPU is visible to the application by using the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`

environment variable.

```
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 cuda-gdb my_app
```

###
3.3.4. Attaching/Detaching[](https://docs.nvidia.com#attaching-detaching)

CUDA-GDB can attach to and detach from a CUDA application running on GPUs with compute capability 2.0 and beyond, using GDB’s built-in commands for attaching to or detaching from a process.

Additionally, if the environment variable `CUDA_DEVICE_WAITS_ON_EXCEPTION`

is set to 1 prior to running the CUDA application, the application will run normally until a device exception occurs. The application will then wait for CUDA-GDB to attach itself to it for further debugging. This feature is not supported on WSL.

Note

By default on some Linux distributions, the debugger cannot attach to an already running processes due to security settings. In order to enable the attach feature of the CUDA debugger, either cuda-gdb should be launched as root, or `/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope`

should be set to zero, using the following command:

```
$ sudo sh -c "echo 0 >/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope"
```

To make the change permanent, edit `/etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf`

.

#
4. CUDA-GDB Extensions[](https://docs.nvidia.com#cuda-gdb-extensions)

##
4.1. Command Naming Convention[](https://docs.nvidia.com#command-naming-convention)

The existing GDB commands are unchanged. Every new CUDA command or option is prefixed with the CUDA keyword. As much as possible, CUDA-GDB command names will be similar to the equivalent GDB commands used for debugging host code. For instance, the GDB command to display the host threads and switch to host thread 1 are, respectively:

```
(cuda-gdb) info threads
(cuda-gdb) thread 1
```

To display the CUDA threads and switch to cuda thread 1, the user only has to type:

```
(cuda-gdb) info cuda threads
(cuda-gdb) cuda thread 1
```

##
4.2. Getting Help[](https://docs.nvidia.com#getting-help)

As with GDB commands, the built-in help for the CUDA commands is accessible from the `cuda-gdb`

command line by using the help command:

```
(cuda-gdb) help cuda name_of_the_cuda_command
(cuda-gdb) help set cuda name_of_the_cuda_option
(cuda-gdb) help info cuda name_of_the_info_cuda_command
```

Moreover, all the CUDA commands can be auto-completed by pressing the TAB key, as with any other GDB command.

CUDA commands can also be queried using the `apropos`

command.

##
4.3. Initialization File[](https://docs.nvidia.com#initialization-file)

The initialization file for CUDA-GDB is named `.cuda-gdbinit`

and follows the same rules as the standard `.gdbinit`

file used by GDB. The initialization file may contain any CUDA- GDB command. Those commands will be processed in order when CUDA-GDB is launched.

##
4.4. GUI Integration[](https://docs.nvidia.com#gui-integration)

**Emacs**

CUDA-GDB works with the GDB/MI interface in Emacs via `M-x gdb`

. No extra step is required other than pointing to the right binary.

Set the `gud-gdb-command-name`

variable to invoke `cuda-gdb`

with the MI interface:

```
(setq gud-gdb-command-name "cuda-gdb -i=mi")
```

Ensure that `cuda-gdb`

is present in the Emacs `$PATH`

.

**DDD**

CUDA-GDB works with DDD. To use DDD with CUDA-GDB, launch DDD with the following command:

```
ddd --debugger cuda-gdb
```

`cuda-gdb`

must be in your `$PATH`

.

##
4.5. GPU core dump support[](https://docs.nvidia.com#gpu-core-dump-support)

There are two ways to configure the core dump options for CUDA applications. Environment variables set in the application environment or programmatically from the application with the [CUDA Driver API](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-driver-api/group__CUDA__COREDUMP.html#group__CUDA__COREDUMP/).

Note

GPU core dump generation is unsupported when other CUDA developer tools, including CUDA-GDB, are interacting with the application, unless explicitly documented as a supported use case (e.g., `generate-core-file`

command).

**Compilation for GPU core dump generation**

GPU core dumps will be generated regardless of compilation flags used to generate the GPU application. For the best debugging experience, it is recommended to compile the application with the `-g -G`

or the `-lineinfo`

option with NVCC. See [Compiling the Application](https://docs.nvidia.com/index.html#compiling-the-application) for more information on passing compilation flags for debugging.

**Enabling GPU core dump generation on exception with environment variables**

Set the `CUDA_ENABLE_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION`

environment variable to `1`

in order to enable generating a GPU core dump when a GPU exception is encountered. This option is disabled by default.

Set the `CUDA_ENABLE_CPU_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION`

environment variable to `0`

in order to disable generating a CPU core dump when a GPU exception is encountered. This option is enabled by default when GPU core dump generation is enabled, but is deprecated in favor of the `CUDA_COREDUMP_GENERATION_FLAGS="skip_abort"`

option.

Note

Enabling core dump generation can impact application performance even if no exception is encountered.

**Controlling behavior of GPU core dump generation**

The `CUDA_COREDUMP_GENERATION_FLAGS`

environment variable can be used when generating GPU core dumps to deviate from default generation behavior. Multiple flags can be provided to this environment variable and are delimited by `,`

. These flags can be used to accomplish tasks such as reducing the size of the generated GPU core dump or other desired behaviors that deviate from the defaults. The table below lists each flag and the behavior when present.

Environment Variable flag |
Description |
|---|---|
|
Disables including copies of nonrelocated elf images in the GPU core dump. Only the relocated images will be present. |
|
Disables dumping of GPU global and constbank memory segments. |
|
Disables dumping of GPU shared memory segments. |
|
Disables dumping of GPU local memory segments. |
|
Disables calling |
|
Disables dumping of GPU constant memory segments. |
|
Compress the coredump file into gzip format. |
|
Dump only the contexts with exceptions. |
|
Disable the implicit “make errors visible at exit” mode used by CUDA coredump. |
|
Do not generate a corefile, only log the exception information (PC, stack trace, kind, etc.).
Use |

Note

Setting the `CUDA_ENABLE_CPU_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION`

environment variable to `0`

is equivalent to `CUDA_COREDUMP_GENERATION_FLAGS="skip_abort"`

.

**Limitations and notes for core dump generation**

The following limitations apply to core dump support:

For Windows WDDM, GPU core dump is only supported on a GPU with compute capability 6.0 or higher. Windows TCC supports GPU core dump on all supported compute capabilities.

GPU core dump is unsupported for the Windows Subsystem for Linux on GPUs running in SLI mode. Multi-GPU setups are supported, but SLI mode cannot be enabled in the Driver Control Panel.

GPU core dump is supported for the Windows Subsystem for Linux only when the

[hardware scheduling mode](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/hardware-accelerated-gpu-scheduling/)is enabled.GPU core dump is supported for the Windows Subsystem for Linux only when the binary being executed is located on the Linux filesystem due to NTFS limitations when executing Linux programs.

Generating a GPU core dump using the

`CUDA_ENABLE_USER_TRIGGERED_COREDUMP`

option is not supported for the Windows Subsystem for Linux.Generating a CPU core dump with

`CUDA_ENABLE_CPU_COREDUMP_ON_EXCEPTION`

is currently unsupported on the QNX platform.GPU core dump is unsupported for the NVIDIA CMP product line.

Per-context core dump can only be enabled on a GPU with compute capability 6.0 or higher. GPUs with compute capability less than 6.0 will return

`CUDA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`

when using the Coredump Attributes Control API.If an MPS client triggers a core dump, every other client running on the same MPS server will fault. The indirectly faulting clients will also generate a core dump if they have core dump generation enabled.

GPU core dump is unsupported when other developer tools, including CUDA-GDB, are interacting with the application. Unless explicitly documented as a supported use case (e.g

`generate-core-file`

command).When generating a coredump on exception, if the kernel exits before the exception has been recognized it may result in failure to generate the corefile. See the note in

[GPU Error Reporting](https://docs.nvidia.com/index.html#gpu-error-reporting)for strategies on how to work around this issue.GPU core dumps do not currently include the device instruction memory that backs each executing function. When CUDA-GDB disassembles a GPU core dump, it uses the original cubin image rather than the device instruction bytes that were present at fault time.


Note

The user should not send the application process a signal and ensure that the application process does not automatically terminate while the coredump generation is in process. Doing so may cause GPU coredump generation to abort.

Note

Starting from CUDA 11.6, the compute-sanitizer tool can generate a GPU core dump when an error is detected by using the `--generate-coredump yes`

option. Once the core dump is generated, the target application will abort. Click [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/compute-sanitizer/ComputeSanitizer/index.html#coredump) for more information on compute-sanitizer documentation.

Note

CPU core dumps will be located in a distribution specific location. Examining the `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`

file will typically hint at the name/location of the CPU core dump.

Note

NVIDIA vGPU platforms must explicitly enable debugging support to perform GPU core dump generation. Please reference the [Virtual GPU Software User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/latest/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html#enabling-cuda-toolkit-development-tools-vgpu/) for information on how to enable debugging on vGPU.

Note

NVIDIA Jetson and Drive Tegra devices must explicitly enable debugging support to perform GPU core dump generation. Refer to the [Using the CUDA-GDB debugger on Jetson and Drive Tegra devices](https://docs.nvidia.com#tegra-setup) section.

Note

When generating core dumps on NVIDIA Drive Tegra devices running QNX, core dump generation may hang when generating CPU core dumps. If a hang is encountered, set `CUDA_ENABLE_CPU_COREDUMP_EXCEPTION`

to 0.

Note

If core dumps are not generated when running programs built with OptiX/RTCore, try setting the environment variable `OPTIX_FORCE_DEPRECATED_LAUNCHER`

to 1. Refer to the [Debugging OptiX/RTCore applications](https://docs.nvidia.com#using-optix) section.

Note

Core dumps generation on Windows and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) require the debug interface to be enabled by setting the registry key `>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\GPUDebugger\EnableInterface`

to `(DWORD) 1`

.

Note

GPU core dump is supported on GPUs running with Confidential Compute mode only with devtools mode. See [Confidential Computing Deployment Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/confidential-computing-deployment-guide.pdf) for more details on how to enable the mode.

**Naming of GPU core dump files**

By default, a GPU core dump is created in the current working directory. It is named `core_TIME_HOSTNAME_PID.nvcudmp`

where `TIME`

is the number of seconds since the Epoch, `HOSTNAME`

is the host name of the machine running the CUDA application and `PID`

is the process identifier of the CUDA application.

The `CUDA_COREDUMP_FILE`

environment variable can be used to define a template that is used to change the name of a GPU core dump file. The template can either be an absolute path or a relative path to the current working directory. The template can contain `%`

specifiers which are substituted by the following patterns when a GPU core dump is created:

Specifier |
Description |
|---|---|
|
Host name of the machine running the CUDA application |
|
Process identifier of the CUDA application |
|
Time as the number of seconds since the Epoch, |

As an example, setting `CUDA_COREDUMP_FILE`

to:

```
export CUDA_COREDUMP_FILE=newName.%h.%p
```

Would result in GPU core dumps being written to `newName.myhost.1234`

relative to the current working directory. Here `myhost`

and `1234`

are replaced with the real host name and pid respectively.

Setting `CUDA_COREDUMP_FILE`

to:

```
export CUDA_COREDUMP_FILE="/home/$USER/newName.%h.%p"
```

Would result in GPU core dumps being written to the user’s home directory with the same name logic as in the above example.

If `CUDA_COREDUMP_FILE`

points to an existing file of FIFO type (e.g named pipe), the core dump will be streamed to it.

Coredumps may be piped to shell commands via `CUDA_COREDUMP_FILE`

with the following format:

```
export CUDA_COREDUMP_FILE='| cmd > file'
```

For example, to pipe a coredump to `gzip`

use:

```
export CUDA_COREDUMP_FILE='| gzip -9 > cuda-coredump.gz'
```

Note

When piping a coredump, the `%`

specifiers will not be recognized.

**Enabling user induced GPU core dump generation**

The user can interrupt a running CUDA process to generate the GPU core dump.

Set the `CUDA_ENABLE_USER_TRIGGERED_COREDUMP`

environment variable to `1`

in order to enable generating a user induced GPU core dump. This option is disabled by default. Setting this environment variable will open a communication pipe for each subsequently running CUDA process. To induce the GPU core dump, the user simply writes to the pipe.

To change the default pipe file name, set the `CUDA_COREDUMP_PIPE`

environment variable to a specific pipe name. The default pipe name is in the following format: `corepipe.cuda.HOSTNAME.PID`

where HOSTNAME is the host name of machine running the CUDA application and PID is the process identifier of the CUDA application. This environment variable can take `%`

specifiers as decribed in the above section.

GPU core dumps can be manually generated using cuda-gdb `generate-core-file`

or `gcore`

command. An optional filename can be passed, see `help generate-core-file`

for details. Several flags are available to control what to save and whether or not to generate a CPU core file along with it.

**Displaying core dump generation progress**

By default, when an application crashes and generates a GPU core dump, the application may appear to be unresponsive or frozen until fully generated.

Set the `CUDA_COREDUMP_SHOW_PROGRESS`

environment variable to `1`

in order to print core dump generation progress messages to `stderr`

. This can be used to determine how far along the coredump generation is:

```
coredump: SM 1/14 has finished state collection
coredump: SM 2/14 has finished state collection
coredump: SM 3/14 has finished state collection
coredump: SM 4/14 has finished state collection
coredump: SM 5/14 has finished state collection
coredump: SM 6/14 has finished state collection
coredump: SM 7/14 has finished state collection
coredump: SM 8/14 has finished state collection
coredump: SM 9/14 has finished state collection
coredump: SM 10/14 has finished state collection
coredump: SM 11/14 has finished state collection
coredump: SM 12/14 has finished state collection
coredump: SM 13/14 has finished state collection
coredump: SM 14/14 has finished state collection
coredump: Device 1/1 has finished state collection

coredump: 90%...
coredump: 95%...
coredump: 100%...
coredump: Writing out device table
coredump: Finalizing
coredump: All done
```

**Enabling GPU core dump generation with the CUDA Driver API**

The Driver API has equivalent settings for all of the environment variables, with the added feature of being able to set different core dump settings per-context instead of globally. This API can be called directly inside your application. Use `cuCoredumpGetAttributeGlobal`

and `cuCoredumpSetAttributeGlobal`

to fetch or set the global attribute. Use `cuCoredumpGetAttribute`

and `cuCoredumpSetAttribute`

to fetch or set the per context attribute. See the [Coredump Attributes Control API](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-driver-api/group__CUDA__COREDUMP.html#group__CUDA__COREDUMP/) manual for more information.

The table below lists the environment variables and the equivalent `CUcoredumpSettings`

flags that are available to manage core dump settings with the Coredump Attributes Control API.

**Inspecting GPU and GPU+CPU core dumps in cuda-gdb**

Use the following command to load the GPU core dump into the debugger

-
(cuda-gdb) target cudacore core.cuda.localhost.1234

This will open the core dump file and print the exception encountered during program execution. Then, issue standard cuda-gdb commands to further investigate application state on the device at the moment it was aborted.


Use the following command to load CPU and GPU core dumps into the debugger

-
(cuda-gdb) target core core.cpu core.cuda

This will open the core dump file and print the exception encountered during program execution. Then, issue standard cuda-gdb commands to further investigate application state on the host and the device at the moment it was aborted.


Note

Coredump inspection does not require that a GPU be installed on the system

#
5. Kernel Focus[](https://docs.nvidia.com#kernel-focus)

A CUDA application may be running several host threads and many device threads. To simplify the visualization of information about the state of application, commands are applied to the entity in focus.

When the focus is set to a host thread, the commands will apply only to that host thread (unless the application is fully resumed, for instance). On the device side, the focus is always set to the lowest granularity level–the device thread.

##
5.1. Software Coordinates vs. Hardware Coordinates[](https://docs.nvidia.com#software-coordinates-vs-hardware-coordinates)

A device thread belongs to a block, which in turn belongs to a kernel. Thread, block, and kernel are the software coordinates of the focus. A device thread runs on a lane. A lane belongs to a warp, which belongs to an SM, which in turn belongs to a device. Lane, warp, SM, and device are the hardware coordinates of the focus. Software and hardware coordinates can be used interchangeably and simultaneously as long as they remain coherent.

Another software coordinate is sometimes used: the grid. The difference between a grid and a kernel is the scope. The grid ID is unique per GPU whereas the kernel ID is unique across all GPUs. Therefore there is a 1:1 mapping between a kernel and a (grid,device) tuple.

##
5.2. Current Focus[](https://docs.nvidia.com#current-focus)

To inspect the current focus, use the cuda command followed by the coordinates of interest:

```
(cuda-gdb) cuda device sm warp lane block thread
block (0,0,0), thread (0,0,0), device 0, sm 0, warp 0, lane 0
(cuda-gdb) cuda kernel block thread
kernel 1, block (0,0,0), thread (0,0,0)
(cuda-gdb) cuda kernel
kernel 1
```

##
5.3. Switching Focus[](https://docs.nvidia.com#switching-focus)

To switch the current focus, use the cuda command followed by the coordinates to be changed:

```
(cuda-gdb) cuda device 0 sm 1 warp 2 lane 3
[Switching focus to CUDA kernel 1, grid 2, block (8,0,0), thread
(67,0,0), device 0, sm 1, warp 2, lane 3]
374 int totalThreads = gridDim.x * blockDim.x;
```

If the specified focus is not fully defined by the command, the debugger will assume that the omitted coordinates are set to the coordinates in the current focus, including the subcoordinates of the block and thread.

```
(cuda-gdb) cuda thread (15)
[Switching focus to CUDA kernel 1, grid 2, block (8,0,0), thread
(15,0,0), device 0, sm 1, warp 0, lane 15]
374 int totalThreads = gridDim.x * blockDim.x;
```

The parentheses for the block and thread arguments are optional.

```
(cuda-gdb) cuda block 1 thread 3
[Switching focus to CUDA kernel 1, grid 2, block (1,0,0), thread (3,0,0),
device 0, sm 3, warp 0, lane 3]
374 int totalThreads = gridDim.x * blockDim.
```

#
6. Program Execution[](https://docs.nvidia.com#program-execution)

Applications are launched the same way in CUDA-GDB as they are with GDB by using the run command. This chapter describes how to interrupt and single-step CUDA applications

##
6.1. Interrupting the Application[](https://docs.nvidia.com#interrupting-the-application)

If the CUDA application appears to be hanging or stuck in an infinite loop, it is possible to manually interrupt the application by pressing CTRL+C. When the signal is received, the GPUs are suspended and the `cuda-gdb`

prompt will appear.

At that point, the program can be inspected, modified, single-stepped, resumed, or terminated at the user’s discretion.

This feature is limited to applications running within the debugger. It is not possible to break into and debug applications that have been launched outside the debugger.

##
6.2. Single Stepping[](https://docs.nvidia.com#single-stepping)

Single-stepping device code is supported. However, unlike host code single-stepping, device code single-stepping works at the warp level. This means that single-stepping a device kernel advances all the active threads in the warp currently in focus. The divergent threads in the warp are not single-stepped. When the CUDA thread in focus becomes divergent, behavior depends on the value of `set cuda step_divergent_lanes`

. When on (default), the warp in focus will be continuously single-stepped until the CUDA thread in focus becomes active. When off, the warp in focus will be stepped and the focused CUDA thread will be changed to the nearest active lane in the warp.

In order to advance the execution of more than one warp, a breakpoint must be set at the desired location and then the application must be fully resumed.

A special case is single-stepping over thread barrier calls like: `__syncthreads()`

or cluster-wide barriers. In this case, an implicit temporary breakpoint is set immediately after the barrier and all threads are resumed until the temporary breakpoint is hit.

You can step in, over, or out of the device functions as long as they are not inlined. To force a function to not be inlined by the compiler, the `__noinline__`

keyword must be added to the function declaration.

Asynchronous SASS instructions executed on the device, such as the warpgroup instructions, at prior PCs are not guaranteed to be complete.

With Dynamic Parallelism, several CUDA APIs can be called directly from device code. The following list defines single-step behavior when encountering these APIs:

When encountering device side kernel launches (denoted by the

`<<<>>>`

launch syntax), the`step`

and`next`

commands will have the same behavior, and both will**step over**the launch call.On devices prior to Hopper (SM 9.0), stepping into the deprecated

`cudaDeviceSynchronize()`

results in undefined behavior. Users shall step over this call instead.When stepping a device grid launch to completion, focus will automatically switch back to the CPU. The

`cuda kernel`

focus switching command must be used to switch to another grid of interest (if one is still resident).

Note

It is not possible to **step into** a device launch call (nor the routine launched by the call).

#
7. Breakpoints and Watchpoints[](https://docs.nvidia.com#breakpoints-and-watchpoints)

There are multiple ways to set a breakpoint on a CUDA application. These methods are described below. The commands used to set a breakpoint on device code are the same as the commands used to set a breakpoint on host code.

If a breakpoint is set on device code, the breakpoint will be marked pending until the ELF image of the kernel is loaded. At that point, the breakpoint will be resolved and its address will be updated.

When a breakpoint is set, it forces all resident GPU threads to stop at this location when it reaches the corresponding PC.

When a breakpoint is hit by one thread, there is no guarantee that the other threads will hit the breakpoint at the same time. Therefore the same breakpoint may be hit several times, and the user must be careful with checking which thread(s) actually hit(s) the breakpoint. The `disable`

command can be used to prevent hitting the breakpoint by additional threads.

##
7.1. Symbolic Breakpoints[](https://docs.nvidia.com#symbolic-breakpoints)

To set a breakpoint at the entry of a function, use the `break`

command followed by the name of the function or method:

```
(cuda-gdb) break my_function
(cuda-gdb) break my_class::my_method
```

For templatized functions and methods, the full signature must be given:

```
(cuda-gdb) break int my_templatized_function<int>(int)
```

The mangled name of the function can also be used. To find the mangled name of a function, you can use the following command:

```
(cuda-gdb) set demangle-style none
(cuda-gdb) info function my_function_name
(cuda-gdb) set demangle-style auto
```

##
7.2. Line Breakpoints[](https://docs.nvidia.com#line-breakpoints)

To set a breakpoint on a specific line number, use the following syntax:

```
(cuda-gdb) break my_file.cu:185
```

If the specified line corresponds to an instruction within templatized code, multiple breakpoints will be created, one for each instance of the templatized code.

##
7.3. Address Breakpoints[](https://docs.nvidia.com#address-breakpoints)

To set a breakpoint at a specific address, use the `break`

command with the address as argument:

```
(cuda-gdb) break *0x1afe34d0
```

The address can be any address on the device or the host.

##
7.4. Kernel Entry Breakpoints[](https://docs.nvidia.com#kernel-entry-breakpoints)

To break on the first instruction of every launched kernel, set the `break_on_launch`

option to application:

```
(cuda-gdb) set cuda break_on_launch application
```

See [set cuda break_on_launch](https://docs.nvidia.com#set-cuda-break-on-launch) for more information.

##
7.5. Conditional Breakpoints[](https://docs.nvidia.com#conditional-breakpoints)

To make the breakpoint conditional, use the optional if keyword or the cond command.

```
(cuda-gdb) break foo.cu:23 if threadIdx.x == 1 && i < 5
(cuda-gdb) cond 3 threadIdx.x == 1 && i < 5
```

Conditional expressions may refer any variable, including built-in variables such as `threadIdx`

and `blockIdx`

. Function calls are not allowed in conditional expressions.

Note that conditional breakpoints are always hit and evaluated, but the debugger reports the breakpoint as being hit only if the conditional statement is evaluated to TRUE. The process of hitting the breakpoint and evaluating the corresponding conditional statement is time-consuming. Therefore, running applications while using conditional breakpoints may slow down the debugging session. Moreover, if the conditional statement is always evaluated to FALSE, the debugger may appear to be hanging or stuck, although it is not the case. You can interrupt the application with CTRL-C to verify that progress is being made.

Conditional breakpoints can be set on code from CUDA modules that are not already loaded. The verification of the condition will then only take place when the ELF image of that module is loaded. Therefore any error in the conditional expression will be deferred until the CUDA module is loaded. To double check the desired conditional expression, first set an unconditional breakpoint at the desired location and continue. When the breakpoint is hit, evaluate the desired conditional statement by using the `cond`

command.

##
7.6. Watchpoints[](https://docs.nvidia.com#watchpoints)

Watchpoints on CUDA code are not supported.

Watchpoints on host code are supported. The user is invited to read the GDB documentation for a tutorial on how to set watchpoints on host code.

#
8. Inspecting Program State[](https://docs.nvidia.com#inspecting-program-state)

##
8.1. Memory and Variables[](https://docs.nvidia.com#memory-and-variables)

The GDB print command has been extended to decipher the location of any program variable and can be used to display the contents of any CUDA program variable including:

data allocated via

`cudaMalloc()`

data that resides in various GPU memory regions, such as shared, local, and global memory

special CUDA runtime variables, such as

`threadIdx`


##
8.2. Variable Storage and Accessibility[](https://docs.nvidia.com#variable-storage-and-accessibility)

Depending on the variable type and usage, variables can be stored either in registers or in `local`

, `shared`

, `constant`

, `global`

or `generic`

(any of the previous) memory. You can print the address of any variable to find out where it is stored and directly access the associated memory.

The example below shows how the variable array, which is of type `shared int *`

, can be directly accessed in order to see what the stored values are in the array.

```
(cuda-gdb) print &array
$1 = (@shared int (*)[0]) 0x20
(cuda-gdb) print array[0]@4
$2 = {0, 128, 64, 192}
```

You can also access the shared memory indexed into the starting offset to see what the stored values are:

```
(cuda-gdb) print *(@shared int*)0x20
$3 = 0
(cuda-gdb) print *(@shared int*)0x24
$4 = 128
(cuda-gdb) print *(@shared int*)0x28
$5 = 64
```

##
8.3. Info CUDA Commands[](https://docs.nvidia.com#info-cuda-commands)

These are commands that display information about the GPU and the application’s CUDA state. The available options are:

`devices`

-
information about all the devices

`sms`

-
information about all the active SMs in the current device

`warps`

-
information about all the active warps in the current SM

`lanes`

-
information about all the active lanes in the current warp

`kernels`

-
information about all the active kernels

`blocks`

-
information about all the active blocks in the current kernel

`threads`

-
information about all the active threads in the current kernel

`launch trace`

-
information about the parent kernels of the kernel in focus

`launch children`

-
information about the kernels launched by the kernels in focus

`kernel_launch_backtrace`

-
information about the CPU call stack collected at kernel launch for the kernel in focus or specified by the kernel number argument

`contexts`

-
information about all the contexts

`clusters`

-
information about all the clusters

`managed`

-
information about all the managed variables

`barriers`

-

A filter can be applied to every `info cuda`

command. The filter restricts the scope of the command. A filter is composed of one or more restrictions. A restriction can be any of the following:

`device n`

`sm n`

`warp n`

`lane n`

`kernel n`

`grid n`

`block x[,y]`

or`block (x[,y])`

`thread x[,y[,z]]`

or`thread (x[,y[,z]])`

`breakpoint all`

and`breakpoint n`


where `n`

, `x`

, `y`

, `z`

are integers, or one of the following special keywords: `current`

, `any`

, and `all`

. `current`

indicates that the corresponding value in the current focus should be used. `any`

and `all`

indicate that any value is acceptable.

Note

The `breakpoint all`

and `breakpoint n`

filter are only effective for the `info cuda threads`

command.

###
8.3.1. info cuda devices[](https://docs.nvidia.com#info-cuda-devices)

This command enumerates all the GPUs in the system sorted by device index. A `*`

indicates the device currently in focus. This command supports filters. The default is `device all`

. This command prints `No CUDA Devices`

if no active GPUs are found. A device is not considered active until the first kernel launch has been encountered.

```
(cuda-gdb) info cuda devices

7 0xffffffff 0x00000000 0x0000000000000000 0 (0,0,0)
...
```

###
8.3.4. info cuda lanes[](https://docs.nvidia.com#info-cuda-lanes)

This command displays all the lanes (threads) for the warp in focus. This command supports filters and the default is `device current sm current warp current lane all`

. In the example below you can see that all the lanes are at the same physical PC. The command can be used to display which lane executes what thread.

```
(cuda-gdb) info cuda lanes

...
```

###
8.3.5. info cuda kernels[](https://docs.nvidia.com#info-cuda-kernels)

This command displays on all the active kernels on the GPU in focus. It prints the SM mask, kernel ID, and the grid ID for each kernel with the associated dimensions and arguments. The kernel ID is unique across all GPUs whereas the grid ID is unique per GPU. The `Parent`

column shows the kernel ID of the parent grid. This command supports filters and the default is `kernel all`

.

```
(cuda-gdb) info cuda kernels
Kernel Parent Dev Grid Status SMs Mask GridDim BlockDim Name Args
* 1 - 0 2 Active 0x00ffffff (240,1,1) (128,1,1) acos_main parms=...
```

This command will also show grids that have been launched on the GPU with Dynamic Parallelism. Kernels with a negative grid ID have been launched from the GPU, while kernels with a positive grid ID have been launched from the CPU.

###
8.3.6. info cuda barriers[](https://docs.nvidia.com#info-cuda-barriers)

This command displays the states of all the lanes (threads) for the warp in focus. The results are grouped per warp. This command supports filters and the default is `device current sm current warp`

.
If there exists warp or block divergence, the command will display the scope that the thread focus is blocked on.
Following this, each line of output represents one or more lanes (CUDA threads).
Each CUDA thread has a state (`Ready`

, `BlockedPlus`

, `Exited`

, etc.). It can be active, exited, participating in a collective region, or synchronized on one or more warp convergence barriers.
The outputs are coalesced by default, so that threads having identical state are grouped together.

```
(cuda-gdb) info cuda barriers
Focus is blocked on a Warp Barrier.
Device 0 SM 0 Wp 0
Ln(s) Thread State Active Exited Collective Warp Convergence Barrier(s)
(0-15) Ready yes no no 1
(16-31) BlockedPlus no no no none
```

When coalescing is turned off the state of every lane (CUDA thread) is displayed per line:

```
(cuda-gdb) set cuda coalescing off
Coalescing of the CUDA commands output is off.
(cuda-gdb) info cuda barriers
Device 0 SM 0 Wp 0
Ln(s) Thread State Active Exited Collective Warp Convergence Barrier(s)
0 Ready yes no no 0
1 Ready yes no no 0
2 Ready yes no no 0
3 Ready yes no no none
4 Ready yes no no 0
5 Ready yes no no 0
...
```

###
8.3.7. info cuda blocks[](https://docs.nvidia.com#info-cuda-blocks)

This command displays all the active or running blocks for the kernel in focus. The results are grouped per kernel. This command supports filters and the default is `kernel current block all`

. The outputs are coalesced by default.

```
(cuda-gdb) info cuda blocks
BlockIdx To BlockIdx Count State
Kernel 1
* (0,0,0) (191,0,0) 192 running
```

Coalescing can be turned off as follows in which case more information on the Device and the SM get displayed:

```
(cuda-gdb) set cuda coalescing off
```

The following is the output of the same command when coalescing is turned off.

```
(cuda-gdb) info cuda blocks
BlockIdx State Dev SM
Kernel 1
* (0,0,0) running 0 0
(1,0,0) running 0 3
(2,0,0) running 0 6

(5,0,0) running 0 15
(6,0,0) running 0 18
(7,0,0) running 0 21
(8,0,0) running 0 1
...
```

###
8.3.8. info cuda clusters[](https://docs.nvidia.com#info-cuda-clusters)

This command displays the application’s active [CUDA thread block clusters](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/01-introduction/programming-model.html#thread-block-clusters), if clusters are enabled.
The command displays to the user the mapping between cluster indexes/dimensions and block indexes.
This allows the user to reason about which blocks belong to which cluster and the sizes present when debugging CUDA kernels with flexible cluster sizes.
This command supports filters and the default is `kernel current cluster all`

. The outputs are coalesced by default as follows:

```
(cuda-gdb) info cuda clusters
ClusterIdx BlockIdx To BlockIdx Count
Kernel 0
ClusterDim (1,1,4)
* (0,0,0) (0,0,0) (0,0,0) 1
(1,0,0) (1,0,0) (1,0,0) 1
(0,1,0) (0,1,0) (0,1,0) 1
(1,1,0) (1,1,0) (1,1,0) 1
(0,0,0) (0,0,1) (0,0,1) 1
(1,0,0) (1,0,1) (1,0,1) 1
(0,1,0) (0,1,1) (0,1,1) 1
(1,1,0) (1,1,1) (1,1,1) 1
(0,0,0) (0,0,2) (0,0,2) 1
(1,0,0) (1,0,2) (1,0,2) 1
(0,1,0) (0,1,2) (0,1,2) 1
(1,1,0) (1,1,2) (1,1,2) 1
(0,0,0) (0,0,3) (0,0,3) 1
(1,0,0) (1,0,3) (1,0,3) 1
(0,1,0) (0,1,3) (0,1,3) 1
(1,1,0) (1,1,3) (1,1,3) 1
```

Note

The ClusterDim corresponds to how many blocks are assigned to each dimension in the cluster. The cluster dimension is the number of blocks in a cluster.

###
8.3.9. info cuda threads[](https://docs.nvidia.com#info-cuda-threads)

This command displays the application’s active CUDA blocks and threads with the total count of threads in those blocks. Also displayed are the virtual PC and the associated source file and the line number information. The results are grouped per kernel. The command supports filters with default being `kernel current block all thread all`

. The outputs are coalesced by default as follows:

```
(cuda-gdb) info cuda threads
BlockIdx ThreadIdx To BlockIdx ThreadIdx Count Virtual PC Filename Line
Device 0 SM 0
* (0,0,0 (0,0,0) (0,0,0) (31,0,0) 32 0x000000000088f88c acos.cu 376

Note

In coalesced form, threads must be contiguous in order to be coalesced. If some threads are not currently running on the hardware, they will create *holes* in the thread ranges. For instance, if a kernel consist of 2 blocks of 16 threads, and only the 8 lowest threads are active, then 2 coalesced ranges will be printed: one range for block 0 thread 0 to 7, and one range for block 1 thread 0 to 7. Because threads 8-15 in block 0 are not running, the 2 ranges cannot be coalesced.

The command also supports `breakpoint all`

and `breakpoint breakpoint_number`

as filters. The former displays the threads that hit all CUDA breakpoints set by the user. The latter displays the threads that hit the CUDA breakpoint *breakpoint_number*.

```

8.3.10. info cuda launch trace[](https://docs.nvidia.com#info-cuda-launch-trace)

This command displays the kernel launch trace for the kernel in focus. The first element in the trace is the kernel in focus. The next element is the kernel that launched this kernel. The trace continues until there is no parent kernel. In that case, the kernel is CPU-launched.

For each kernel in the trace, the command prints the level of the kernel in the trace, the kernel ID, the device ID, the grid Id, the status, the kernel dimensions, the kernel name, and the kernel arguments.

```
(cuda-gdb) info cuda launch trace
Lvl Kernel Dev Grid Status GridDim BlockDim Invocation
* 0 3 0 -7 Active (32,1,1) (16,1,1) kernel3(c=5)
1 2 0 -5 Terminated (240,1,1) (128,1,1) kernel2(b=3)
2 1 0 2 Active (240,1,1) (128,1,1) kernel1(a=1)
```

A kernel that has been launched but that is not running on the GPU will have a `Pending`

status. A kernel currently running on the GPU will be marked as `Active`

. A kernel waiting to become active again will be displayed as `Sleeping`

. When a kernel has terminated, it is marked as `Terminated`

. For the few cases, when the debugger cannot determine if a kernel is pending or terminated, the status is set to `Undetermined`

.

This command supports filters and the default is `kernel all`

.

###
8.3.11. info cuda launch children[](https://docs.nvidia.com#info-cuda-launch-children)

This command displays the list of non-terminated kernels launched by the kernel in focus. For each kernel, the kernel ID, the device ID, the grid Id, the kernel dimensions, the kernel name, and the kernel parameters are displayed.

```
(cuda-gdb) info cuda launch children
Kernel Dev Grid GridDim BlockDim Invocation
* 3 0 -7 (1,1,1) (1,1,1) kernel5(a=3)
18 0 -8 (1,1,1) (32,1,1) kernel4(b=5)
```

This command supports filters and the default is `kernel all`

.

###
8.3.12. info cuda kernel_launch_backtrace[](https://docs.nvidia.com#info-cuda-kernel-launch-backtrace)

This command displays the kernel launch backtrace for a kernel. It prints the kernel ID and the kernel invocation, then the device-side backtrace for the kernel, followed by the host call stack that launched the kernel.

If a kernel is not specified, the command uses the kernel in focus. If no kernel launch
backtrace is available, the command prints `No CUDA kernel launch backtrace available.`

.

To enable this feature, use `set cuda kernel_launch_backtrace on`

and restart the
target application. Enabling this feature slows down the target application because
the debugger collects the CPU call stack at each kernel launch site.

```
(cuda-gdb) info cuda kernel_launch_backtrace

```

###
8.3.13. info cuda contexts[](https://docs.nvidia.com#info-cuda-contexts)

This command enumerates all the CUDA contexts running on all GPUs. A `*`

indicates the context currently in focus. This command shows whether a context is currently active on a device or not.

```
(cuda-gdb) info cuda contexts
Context Dev State
0x080b9518 0 inactive
* 0x08067948 0 active
```

###
8.3.14. info cuda managed[](https://docs.nvidia.com#info-cuda-managed)

This command shows all the static managed variables on the device or on the host depending on the focus.

```
(cuda-gdb) info cuda managed
Static managed variables on device 0 are:
managed_var = 3
managed_consts = {one = 1, e = 2.71000004, pi = 3.1400000000000001}
```

##
8.4. Disassembly[](https://docs.nvidia.com#disassembly)

The device SASS code can be disassembled using the standard GDB disassembly instructions such as `x/i`

and `display/i`

.

```
(cuda-gdb) x/4i $pc-32
0xa689a8 <acos_main(acosParams)+824>: MOV R0, c[0x0][0x34]
0xa689b8 <acos_main(acosParams)+840>: MOV R3, c[0x0][0x28]
0xa689c0 <acos_main(acosParams)+848>: IMUL R2, R0, R3
=> 0xa689c8 <acos_main(acosParams)+856>: MOV R0, c[0x0][0x28]
```

Note

For disassembly instruction to work properly, `cuobjdump`

must be installed and present in your `$PATH`

.

In the disassembly view, the current pc is prefixed with `=>`

. If an instruction triggers an exception it will be prefixed with `*>`

. If the pc and errorpc are the same instruction it will be prefixed with `*=>`

.

For example, consider the following exception:

```
CUDA Exception: Warp Illegal Address
The exception was triggered at PC 0x555555c08620 (memexceptions_kernel.cu:17)
Thread 1 "memexceptions" received signal CUDA_EXCEPTION_14, Warp Illegal Address.
[Switching focus to CUDA kernel 0, grid 1, block (0,0,0), thread (0,0,0), device 0, sm 0, warp 0, lane 0]
0x0000555555c08fb0 in exception_kernel<<<(1,1,1),(1,1,1)>>> (data=0x7fffccc00000, exception=MMU_FAULT) at memexceptions_kernel.cu:50
50 }
(cuda-gdb)
```

The `disas`

command can be used to view both the PC and the error PC that triggered the exception.

```
(cuda-gdb) disas $pc,+16
Dump of assembler code from 0x555555c08fb0 to 0x555555c08fc0:
=> 0x0000555555c08fb0 <_Z16exception_kernelPv11exception_t+3504>: ERRBAR
End of assembler dump.
```

```
(cuda-gdb) disas $errorpc,+16
Dump of assembler code from 0x555555c08620 to 0x555555c08630:
*> 0x0000555555c08620 <_Z16exception_kernelPv11exception_t+1056>: ST.E.U8.STRONG.SYS [R6.64], R5
End of assembler dump.
```

##
8.5. Registers[](https://docs.nvidia.com#registers)

The device registers code can be inspected/modified using the standard GDB commands such as `info registers`

.

```
(cuda-gdb) info registers $R0 $R1 $R2 $R3
R0 0xf0 240
R1 0xfffc48 16776264
R2 0x7800 30720
R3 0x80 128
```

The registers are also accessible as `$R<regnum>`

built-in variables, for example:

```
(cuda-gdb) printf "%d %d\n", $R0*$R3, $R2
30720 30720
```

Values of predicate can be inspected by printing system registers group or by using their respective pseudo-names: `$P0`

..`$P6`

.

```
(cuda-gdb) info registers system
P0 0x1 1
P1 0x1 1
P2 0x0 0
P3 0x0 0
P4 0x0 0
P5 0x0 0
P6 0x1 1
```

##
8.6. Const banks[](https://docs.nvidia.com#const-banks)

Memory allocated in the constant address space of GPU memory resides in two dimensional arrays called constant banks.
Constant banks are noted `c[X][Y]`

where `X`

is the bank number and `Y`

the offset.
The memory address of a given bank/offset pair is obtained via the convenience function `$_cuda_const_bank(bank, offset)`

.

```
(cuda-gdb) disass $pc,+16
Dump of assembler code from 0x7fffd5043d40 to 0x7fffd5043d50:
=> 0x00007fffd5043d40 <_Z9acos_main10acosParams+1856>: MOV R0, c[0x0][0xc]
End of assembler dump.
(cuda-gdb) p *$_cuda_const_bank(0x0,0xc)
$1 = 8
```

##
8.7. Bindless constants[](https://docs.nvidia.com#bindless-constants)

Some constant memory references use a bindless constant header instead of a constant bank number.
The memory address of a given header/offset pair is obtained via the convenience function `$_cuda_bindless_const(header, offset)`

.
The `header`

argument is the 64-bit bindless constant header value and `offset`

is the byte offset within the range described by the header.
The returned pointer refers to CUDA constant memory and can be dereferenced like the value returned by `$_cuda_const_bank`

.

```
(cuda-gdb) disass $pc,+16
Dump of assembler code from 0x7fffd5043d40 to 0x7fffd5043d50:
=> 0x00007fffd5043d40 <bindless_const>: LDC.64 R4, cx[UR0][0]
End of assembler dump.
(cuda-gdb) set $bindlessHeader = ((unsigned long long)$UR1 << 32) | $UR0
(cuda-gdb) p/x *$_cuda_bindless_const($bindlessHeader, 0)
$1 = 0x01234567
```

An error is reported if the header does not describe a valid constant memory range for the requested offset.

10. Event Notifications[](https://docs.nvidia.com#event-notifications)

As the application is making forward progress, CUDA-GDB can notify users about CUDA context events. Within CUDA-GDB, *context* refers to the virtual address space on the GPU for the kernel. You can enable output of CUDA context events to review the flow of the active contexts. By default, context event messages are not displayed.

##
10.1. Context Events[](https://docs.nvidia.com#context-events)

Any time a CUDA context is created, pushed, popped, or destroyed by the application, CUDA-GDB can optionally display a notification message. The message includes the context id and the device id to which the context belongs.

```
[Context Create of context 0xad2fe60 on Device 0]
[Context Destroy of context 0xad2fe60 on Device 0]
```

By default, context event notification is disabled. The context event notification policy is controlled with the `context_events`

option.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda context_events off

CUDA-GDB does not display the context event notification messages (default).

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda context_events on

CUDA-GDB displays the context event notification messages.


#
11. Automatic Error Checking[](https://docs.nvidia.com#automatic-error-checking)

##
11.1. Checking API Errors[](https://docs.nvidia.com#checking-api-errors)

CUDA-GDB can automatically check the return code of any driver API or runtime API call. If the return code indicates an error, the debugger will stop or warn the user.

The behavior is controlled with the `set cuda api_failures`

option. Five modes are supported:

`hide`

CUDA API call failures are not reported`ignore`

Warning message is printed for every fatal CUDA API call failure (default)`stop`

The application is stopped when a CUDA API call returns a fatal error`ignore_all`

Warning message is printed for every CUDA API call failure`stop_all`

The application is stopped when a CUDA API call returns any error

Note

The success return code and other non-error return codes are ignored. For the driver API, those are: `CUDA_SUCCESS`

and `CUDA_ERROR_NOT_READY`

. For the runtime API, they are `cudaSuccess`

and `cudaErrorNotReady`

.

##
11.2. GPU Error Reporting[](https://docs.nvidia.com#gpu-error-reporting)

With improved GPU error reporting in CUDA-GDB, application bugs are now easier to identify and easy to fix. The following table shows the new errors that are reported on GPUs with compute capability `sm_75`

and higher.

Note

**Continuing the execution of your application after these errors are found can lead to application termination or indeterminate results.**

Note

Warp errors may result in instructions to continue executing before the exception is recognized and reported. The reported `$errorpc`

shall contain the precise address of the instruction that caused the exception. If the warp exits after the instruction causing exception has executed, but before the exception has been recognized and reported, it may result in the exception not being reported. CUDA-GDB relies on an active warp present on the device in order to report exceptions. To help avoid this scenario of unreported exceptions:


Add

`while(1);`

before kernel exit. This shall ensure the exception is recognized and reported.Rely on the compute-sanitizer

`memcheck`

tool to catch accesses that can lead to an exception.

##
11.3. Autostep[](https://docs.nvidia.com#autostep)

Autostep is a command to increase the precision of CUDA exceptions to the exact lane and instruction, when they would not have been otherwise.

Under normal execution, an exception may be reported several instructions after the exception occurred, or the exact thread where an exception occurred may not be known unless the exception is a lane error. However, the precise origin of the exception can be determined if the program is being single-stepped when the exception occurs. Single- stepping manually is a slow and tedious process; stepping takes much longer than normal execution and the user has to single-step each warp individually.

Autostep aides the user by allowing them to specify sections of code where they suspect an exception could occur, and these sections are automatically and transparently single- stepped the program is running. The rest of the program is executed normally to minimize the slow-down caused by single-stepping. The precise origin of an exception will be reported if the exception occurs within these sections. Thus the exact instruction and thread where an exception occurred can be found quickly and with much less effort by using autostep.

Note

The `autostep`

command is implemented using breakpoints. If an autostep is set on the current PC, the autostep won’t be evaluated until the next time the PC is encountered.

**Autostep Usage**

```
autostep [LOCATION]
autostep [LOCATION] for LENGTH [lines|instructions]
```

`LOCATION`

may be anything that you use to specify the location of a breakpoint, such as a line number, function name, or an instruction address preceded by an asterisk. If no`LOCATION`

is specified, then the current instruction address is used.`LENGTH`

specifies the size of the autostep window in number of lines or instructions (*lines*and*instructions*can be shortened, e.g.,*l*or*i*). If the length type is not specified, then*lines*is the default. If the`for`

clause is omitted, then the default is 1 line.`astep`

can be used as an alias for the`autostep`

command.Calls to functions made during an autostep will be stepped over.

In case of divergence, the length of the autostep window is determined by the number of lines or instructions the first active lane in each warp executes.


Divergent lanes are also single stepped, but the instructions they execute do not count towards the length of the autostep window.If a breakpoint occurs while inside an autostep window, the warp where the breakpoint was hit will not continue autostepping when the program is resumed. However, other warps may continue autostepping.

Overlapping autosteps are not supported.


If an autostep is encountered while another autostep is being executed, then the second autostep is ignored.

If an autostep is set before the location of a memory error and no memory error is hit, then it is possible that the chosen window is too small. This may be caused by the presence of function calls between the address of the autostep location and the instruction that triggers the memory error. In that situation, either increase the size of the window to make sure that the faulty instruction is included, or move to the autostep location to an instruction that will be executed closer in time to the faulty instruction.

**Related Commands**

Autosteps and breakpoints share the same numbering so most commands that work with breakpoints will also work with autosteps.

`info autosteps`

shows all breakpoints and autosteps. It is similar to `info breakpoints`

.

```
(cuda-gdb) info autosteps
Num Type Disp Enb Address What
1 autostep keep y 0x0000000000401234 in merge at sort.cu:30 for 49 instructions
3 autostep keep y 0x0000000000489913 in bubble at sort.cu:94 for 11 lines
```

`disable autosteps`

disables an autostep. It is equivalent to `disable breakpoints n`

.

`delete autosteps n`

deletes an autostep. It is quivalent to `delete breakpoints n`

.

`ignore n i`

tells the debugger to not single-step the next *i* times the debugger enters the window for autostep *n*. This command already exists for breakpoints.

12. Walk-Through Examples[](https://docs.nvidia.com#walk-through-examples)

The chapter contains three CUDA-GDB walk-through examples:

##
12.1. Example: bitreverse[](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-bitreverse)

This section presents a walk-through of CUDA-GDB by debugging a sample application–called `bitreverse`

–that performs a simple 8 bit reversal on a data set.

**Source Code**

```
1 #include <stdio.h>
2 #include <stdlib.h>
3
4 // Simple 8-bit bit reversal Compute test

6 #define N 256
7
8 __global__ void bitreverse(void *data) {

22 }
23
24 int main(void) {
25 void *d = NULL; int i;
26 unsigned int idata[N], odata[N];
27
28 for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
29 idata[i] = (unsigned int)i;

41 printf("%u -> %u\n", idata[i], odata[i]);
42
43 cudaFree((void*)d);
44 return 0;
45 }
```

###
12.1.1. Walking through the Code[](https://docs.nvidia.com#walking-through-the-code)

-
Begin by compiling the

`bitreverse.cu`

CUDA application for debugging by entering the following command at a shell prompt:$ nvcc -g -G bitreverse.cu -o bitreverse

This command assumes that the source file name is

`bitreverse.cu`

and that no additional compiler flags are required for compilation. See also[Debug Compilation](https://docs.nvidia.com#debug-compilation) -
Start the CUDA debugger by entering the following command at a shell prompt:

$ cuda-gdb bitreverse

-
Set breakpoints. Set both the host (

`main`

) and GPU (`bitreverse`

) breakpoints here. Also, set a breakpoint at a particular line in the device function (`bitreverse.cu:18`

).(cuda-gdb) break main Breakpoint 1 at 0x18e1: file bitreverse.cu, line 25. (cuda-gdb) break bitreverse Breakpoint 2 at 0x18a1: file bitreverse.cu, line 8. (cuda-gdb) break 21 Breakpoint 3 at 0x18ac: file bitreverse.cu, line 21.

-
Run the CUDA application, and it executes until it reaches the first breakpoint (

`main`

) set in the previous step.(cuda-gdb) run Starting program: /Users/CUDA_User1/docs/bitreverse Reading symbols for shared libraries ..++........................................................... done Breakpoint 1, main () at bitreverse.cu:25 25 void *d = NULL; int i;

-
At this point, commands can be entered to advance execution or to print the program state. For this walkthrough, let’s continue until the device kernel is launched.

(cuda-gdb) continue Continuing. Reading symbols for shared libraries .. done Reading symbols for shared libraries .. done [Context Create of context 0x80f200 on Device 0] Breakpoint 3 at 0x8667b8: file bitreverse.cu, line 21. [Switching focus to CUDA kernel 0, grid 1, block (0,0,0), thread (0,0,0), device 0, sm 0, warp 0, lane 0] Breakpoint 2, bitreverse<<<(1,1,1),(256,1,1)>>> (data=0x110000) at bitreverse.cu:9 9 unsigned int *idata = (unsigned int*)data;

CUDA−GDB has detected that a CUDA device kernel has been reached. The debugger prints the current CUDA thread of focus.

-
Verify the CUDA thread of focus with the

`info cuda threads`

command and switch between host thread and the CUDA threads:(cuda-gdb) info cuda threads BlockIdx ThreadIdx To BlockIdx ThreadIdx Count Virtual PC Filename Line Kernel 0 * (0,0,0) (0,0,0) (0,0,0) (255,0,0) 256 0x0000000000866400 bitreverse.cu 9 (cuda-gdb) thread [Current thread is 1 (process 16738)] (cuda-gdb) thread 1 [Switching to thread 1 (process 16738)] #0 0x000019d5 in main () at bitreverse.cu:34 34 bitreverse<<<1, N, N*sizeof(int)>>>(d); (cuda-gdb) backtrace #0 0x000019d5 in main () at bitreverse.cu:34 (cuda-gdb) info cuda kernels Kernel Dev Grid SMs Mask GridDim BlockDim Name Args 0 0 1 0x00000001 (1,1,1) (256,1,1) bitreverse data=0x110000 (cuda-gdb) cuda kernel 0 [Switching focus to CUDA kernel 0, grid 1, block (0,0,0), thread (0,0,0), device 0, sm 0, warp 0, lane 0] 9 unsigned int *idata = (unsigned int*)data; (cuda-gdb) backtrace #0 bitreverse<<<(1,1,1),(256,1,1)>>> (data=0x110000) at bitreverse.cu:9

-
Corroborate this information by printing the block and thread indexes:

(cuda-gdb) print blockIdx $1 = {x = 0, y = 0} (cuda-gdb) print threadIdx $2 = {x = 0, y = 0, z = 0)

-
The grid and block dimensions can also be printed:

(cuda-gdb) print gridDim $3 = {x = 1, y = 1} (cuda-gdb) print blockDim $4 = {x = 256, y = 1, z = 1)

-
Advance kernel execution and verify some data:

(cuda-gdb) next 12 array[threadIdx.x] = idata[threadIdx.x]; (cuda-gdb) next 14 array[threadIdx.x] = ((0xf0f0f0f0 & array[threadIdx.x]) >> 4) | (cuda-gdb) next 16 array[threadIdx.x] = ((0xcccccccc & array[threadIdx.x]) >> 2) | (cuda-gdb) next 18 array[threadIdx.x] = ((0xaaaaaaaa & array[threadIdx.x]) >> 1) | (cuda-gdb) next Breakpoint 3, bitreverse <<<(1,1),(256,1,1)>>> (data=0x100000) at bitreverse.cu:21 21 idata[threadIdx.x] = array[threadIdx.x]; (cuda-gdb) print array[0]@12 $7 = {0, 128, 64, 192, 32, 160, 96, 224, 16, 144, 80, 208} (cuda-gdb) print/x array[0]@12 $8 = {0x0, 0x80, 0x40, 0xc0, 0x20, 0xa0, 0x60, 0xe0, 0x10, 0x90, 0x50, 0xd0} (cuda-gdb) print &data $9 = (@global void * @parameter *) 0x10 (cuda-gdb) print *(@global void * @parameter *) 0x10 $10 = (@global void * @parameter) 0x100000

The resulting output depends on the current content of the memory location.

-
Since thread (

`0,0,0`

) reverses the value of`0`

, switch to a different thread to show more interesting data:(cuda-gdb) cuda thread 170 [Switching focus to CUDA kernel 0, grid 1, block (0,0,0), thread (170,0,0), device 0, sm 0, warp 5, lane 10]

-
Delete the breakpoints and continue the program to completion:

(cuda-gdb) delete breakpoints Delete all breakpoints? (y or n) y (cuda-gdb) continue Continuing. Program exited normally. (cuda-gdb)


##
12.2. Example: autostep[](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-autostep)

This section shows how to use the autostep command and demonstrates how it helps increase the precision of memory error reporting.

**Source Code**

```
1 #define NUM_BLOCKS 8
2 #define THREADS_PER_BLOCK 64
3
4 __global__ void example(int **data) {
5 int value1, value2, value3, value4, value5;
6 int idx1, idx2, idx3;
7
8 idx1 = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
9 idx2 = threadIdx.x;
10 idx3 = idx1 + idx2;
11 value1 = *(data[idx1]);
12 value2 = *(data[idx2]);
13 value3 = value1 + value2;
14 value4 = value1 * value2;
15 value5 = value3 + value4;
16 *(data[idx3]) = value5;
17 *(data[idx1]) = value3;
18 *(data[idx2]) = value4;
19 idx1 = idx2 = idx3 = 0;
20 }
21
22 int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
23 int *host_data[NUM_BLOCKS * THREADS_PER_BLOCK];
24 int **dev_data;
25 const int zero = 0;
26
27 /* Allocate an integer for each thread in each block */
28 for (int block = 0; block < NUM_BLOCKS; block++) {
29 for (int thread = 0; thread < THREADS_PER_BLOCK; thread++) {
30 int idx = thread + block * THREADS_PER_BLOCK;
31 cudaMalloc(&host_data[idx], sizeof(int));
32 cudaMemcpy(host_data[idx], &zero, sizeof(int),
33 cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
34 }
35 }
36
37 /* This inserts an error into block 3, thread 39*/
38 host_data[3*THREADS_PER_BLOCK + 39] = NULL;
39
40 /* Copy the array of pointers to the device */
41 cudaMalloc((void**)&dev_data, sizeof(host_data));
42 cudaMemcpy(dev_data, host_data, sizeof(host_data), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
43
44 /* Execute example */
45 example <<< NUM_BLOCKS, THREADS_PER_BLOCK >>> (dev_data);
46 cudaThreadSynchronize();
47 }
```

In this small example, we have an array of pointers to integers, and we want to do some operations on the integers. Suppose, however, that one of the pointers is NULL as shown in line 38. This will cause `CUDA_EXCEPTION_10 "Device Illegal Address"`

to be thrown when we try to access the integer that corresponds with block 3, thread 39. This exception should occur at line 16 when we try to write to that value.

###
12.2.1. Debugging with Autosteps[](https://docs.nvidia.com#debugging-with-autosteps)

-
Compile the example and start CUDA−GDB as normal. We begin by running the program:

(cuda-gdb) run Starting program: /home/jitud/cudagdb_test/autostep_ex/example [Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled] [New Thread 0x7ffff5688700 (LWP 9083)] [Context Create of context 0x617270 on Device 0] Program received signal CUDA_EXCEPTION_10, Device Illegal Address. [Switching focus to CUDA kernel 0, grid 1, block (1,0,0), thread (0,0,0), device 0, sm 1, warp 0, lane 0] 0x0000000000796f60 in example (data=0x200300000) at example.cu:17 17 *(data[idx1]) = value3;

As expected, we received a

`CUDA_EXCEPTION_10`

. However, the reported thread is block 1, thread 0 and the line is 17. Since`CUDA_EXCEPTION_10`

is a Global error, there is no thread information that is reported, so we would manually have to inspect all 512 threads. -
Set

`autosteps`

. To get more accurate information, we reason that since`CUDA_EXCEPTION_10`

is a memory access error, it must occur on code that accesses memory. This happens on lines 11, 12, 16, 17, and 18, so we set two autostep windows for those areas:(cuda-gdb) autostep 11 for 2 lines Breakpoint 1 at 0x796d18: file example.cu, line 11. Created autostep of length 2 lines (cuda-gdb) autostep 16 for 3 lines Breakpoint 2 at 0x796e90: file example.cu, line 16. Created autostep of length 3 lines

-
Finally, we run the program again with these autosteps:

(cuda-gdb) run The program being debugged has been started already. Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y Starting program: /home/jitud/cudagdb_test/autostep_ex/example [Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled] [New Thread 0x7ffff5688700 (LWP 9089)] [Context Create of context 0x617270 on Device 0] [Switching focus to CUDA kernel 1, grid 1, block (0,0,0), thread (0,0,0), device 0, sm 0, warp 0, lane 0] Program received signal CUDA_EXCEPTION_10, Device Illegal Address. [Current focus set to CUDA kernel 1, grid 1, block (3,0,0), thread (32,0,0), device 0, sm 1, warp 3, lane 0] Autostep precisely caught exception at example.cu:16 (0x796e90)

This time we correctly caught the exception at line 16. Even though

`CUDA_EXCEPTION_10`

is a global error, we have now narrowed it down to a warp error, so we now know that the thread that threw the exception must have been in the same warp as block 3, thread 32.

In this example, we have narrowed down the scope of the error from 512 threads down to 32 threads just by setting two `autosteps`

and re−running the program.

##
12.3. Example: MPI CUDA Application[](https://docs.nvidia.com#example-mpi-cuda-application)

For large scale MPI CUDA application debugging, NVIDIA recommends using parallel debuggers supplied by our partners Allinea and Totalview. Both make excellent parallel debuggers with extended support for CUDA. However, for debugging smaller applications, or for debugging just a few processes in a large application, CUDA-GDB can be used.

If the cluster nodes have xterm support, launch CUDA-GDB in the same way you would launch gdb with your job launcher. For example:

```
$ mpirun -np 4 -host nv1,nv2 xterm -e cuda-gdb a.out
```

You may have to export the `DISPLAY`

variable to make sure that the xterm finds its way back to your display. For example:

```
$ mpirun -np 4 -host nv1,nv2 -x DISPLAY=host.nvidia.com:0 xterm -e cuda-gdb a.out
```

Job launchers have different ways of exporting environment variables to the cluster nodes. Consult your job launcher documentation for more details.

When xterm is not supported by your cluster environment, you can insert a spin loop inside your program, ssh to the compute node(s), and attach onto the MPI processes. Somewhere near the start of your program, add a code snippet similar to the following:

```
{
int i = 0;
char host[256];
printf("PID %d on node %s is ready for attach\n",
getpid(), host);
fflush(stdout);
while (0 == i) {
sleep(5);
}
}
```

Recompile and launch the application. After it starts, ssh to the node(s) of interest and attach to the process using CUDA-GDB. Set the variable `i`

to 1 to break out of the loop:

```
$ mpirun -np 2 -host nv1,nv2 a.out
PID 20060 on node nv1 is ready for attach
PID 5488 on node nv2 is ready for attach
```

```
$ ssh nv1
[nv1]$ cuda-gdb --pid 5488
```

```
$ ssh nv2
[nv2]$ cuda-gdb --pid 20060
```

For larger applications, you can conditionalize the spin loop based on the MPI rank using the `MPI_Comm_rank`

function.

If `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`

is set, it may cause problems with the GPU selection logic in the MPI application. It may also prevent CUDA IPC working between GPUs on a node.

#
13. Tips and Tricks[](https://docs.nvidia.com#tips-and-tricks)

This section serves as reference to advanced settings and various tips and tricks users of CUDA-GDB can utilize which are not documented elsewhere.

##
13.1. set cuda break_on_launch[](https://docs.nvidia.com#set-cuda-break-on-launch)

To break on the first instruction of every launched kernel, set the `break_on_launch`

option to application:

```
(cuda-gdb) set cuda break_on_launch application
```

Possible options are:

`none`

-
no kernel, application or system (default)

`application`

-
kernel launched by the user application

`system`

-
any kernel launched by the driver, such as memset

`all`

-
any kernel, application and system


Those automatic breakpoints are not displayed by the info breakpoints command and are managed separately from individual breakpoints. Turning off the option will not delete other individual breakpoints set to the same address and vice-versa.

##
13.2. set cuda launch_blocking[](https://docs.nvidia.com#set-cuda-launch-blocking)

When enabled, the kernel launches are synchronous as if the environment variable `CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING`

had been set to 1. Once blocking, the launches are effectively serialized and may be easier to debug.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda launch_blocking off

The kernel launches are launched synchronously or asynchronously as dictacted by the application. This is the default.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda launch_blocking on

The kernel launches are synchronous. If the application has already started, the change will only take affect after the current session has terminated.


Note

This feature is provided for debugging purposes only as it may significantly impact the performance of the application. It is not recommended to use this option in production environment.
See the [Concurrent Execution between Host and Device](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/02-basics/asynchronous-execution.html#what-is-asynchronous-concurrent-execution) part of the CUDA Programming Guide for more information.

##
13.3. set cuda notify[](https://docs.nvidia.com#set-cuda-notify)

Any time a CUDA event occurs, the debugger needs to be notified. The notification takes place in the form of a signal being sent to a host thread. The host thread to receive that special signal is determined with the `set cuda notify`

option.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda notify youngest

The host thread with the smallest thread id will receive the notification signal (default).

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda notify random

An arbitrary host thread will receive the notification signal.


##
13.4. set cuda printf_flushing[](https://docs.nvidia.com#set-cuda-printf-flushing)

When enabled, all printf calls from CUDA threads will be made visible when a GPU breakpoint is hit. Note that printf calls are always flushed after a device exception.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda printf_flushing on

The debugger will flush all printf calls from CUDA threads when a GPU breakpoint is hit.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda printf_flushing off

The debugger will not flush printf calls from CUDA threads when a GPU breakpoint is hit. This is the default.


##
13.5. set cuda ptx_cache[](https://docs.nvidia.com#set-cuda-ptx-cache)

Before accessing the value of a variable, the debugger checks whether the variable is live or not at the current PC. On CUDA devices, the variables may not be live all the time and will be reported as “Optimized Out”.

CUDA-GDB offers an option to circumvent this limitation by caching the value of the variable at the PTX register level. Each source variable is compiled into a PTX register, which is later mapped to one or more hardware registers. Using the debug information emitted by the compiler, the debugger may be able cache the value of a PTX register based on the latest hardware register it was mapped to at an earlier time.

This optimization is always correct. When enabled, the cached value will be displayed as the normal value read from an actual hardware register and indicated with the `(cached)`

prefix. The optimization will only kick in while single-stepping the code.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda ptx_cache off

The debugger only read the value of live variables.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda ptx_cache on

The debugger will use the cached value when possible. This setting is the default and is always safe.


##
13.6. set cuda single_stepping_optimizations[](https://docs.nvidia.com#set-cuda-single-stepping-optimizations)

Single-stepping can take a lot of time. When enabled, this option tells the debugger to use safe tricks to accelerate single-stepping.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda single_stepping_optimizations off

The debugger will not try to accelerate single-stepping. This is the unique and default behavior in the 5.5 release and earlier.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda single_stepping_optimizations on

The debugger will use safe techniques to accelerate single-stepping. This is the default starting with the 6.0 release.


##
13.7. set cuda thread_selection[](https://docs.nvidia.com#set-cuda-thread-selection)

When the debugger must choose an active thread to focus on, the decision is guided by a heuristics. The `set cuda thread_selection`

guides those heuristics.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda thread_selection logical

The thread with the lowest blockIdx/threadIdx coordinates is selected.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda thread_selection physical

The thread with the lowest dev/sm/warp/lane coordinates is selected.


##
13.8. set cuda value_extrapolation[](https://docs.nvidia.com#set-cuda-value-extrapolation)

Before accessing the value of a variable, the debugger checks whether the variable is live or not at the current PC. On CUDA devices, the variables may not be live all the time and will be reported as “Optimized Out”.

CUDA-GDB offers an option to opportunistically circumvent this limitation by extrapolating the value of a variable when the debugger would otherwise mark it as optimized out. The extrapolation is not guaranteed to be accurate and must be used carefully. If the register that was used to store the value of a variable has been reused since the last time the variable was seen as live, then the reported value will be wrong. Therefore, any value printed using the option will be marked as `"(possibly)"`

.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda value_extrapolation off

The debugger only read the value of live variables. This setting is the default and is always safe.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda value_extrapolation on

The debugger will attempt to extrapolate the value of variables beyound their respecitve live ranges. This setting may report erroneous values.


##
13.9. set cuda driver_logs[](https://docs.nvidia.com#set-cuda-driver-logs)

This option controls whether CUDA driver logs are collected and displayed by the debugger. When enabled, log messages from the CUDA driver are shown by the debugger.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda driver_logs off

CUDA driver logs collection is disabled.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda driver_logs on

CUDA driver logs are collected from the driver and displayed by the debugger. This is the default.


##
13.10. set cuda driver_log_level[](https://docs.nvidia.com#set-cuda-driver-log-level)

This option sets the minimum severity level for CUDA driver logs to display. Only log messages at or above the specified severity level will be shown.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda driver_log_level error

Print only CUDA driver errors. This is the default.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda driver_log_level warning

Print CUDA driver errors and warnings.

-
(cuda-gdb) set cuda driver_log_level extra

Same as ‘warning’, but adds printing of logging thread IDs and log timestamps. Thread IDs are the return value of pthread_self() printed in hex, and timestamps are in local time formatted as HH:MM:SS.ms.


##
13.11. Debugging Docker Containers[](https://docs.nvidia.com#debugging-docker-containers)

When debugging an application within a Docker container, the PTRACE capability needs to be enabled. The user needs to also ensure that the root file system has both read/write permissions set.

To enable the PTRACE capability, add the following to your Docker run command:

```
--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE
```

##
13.12. Thread Block Clusters[](https://docs.nvidia.com#thread-block-clusters)

CUDA applications that make use of Thread Block Clusters will see the cluster index displayed in the CUDA focus. Both cluster index and cluster dimension can be queried by printing the convenience variables `clusterIdx`

and `clusterDim`

.

##
13.13. Debugging OptiX/RTCore applications[](https://docs.nvidia.com#debugging-optix-rtcore-applications)

When debugging programs built with OptiX/RTCore, it may be necessary to set the environment variable `OPTIX_FORCE_DEPRECATED_LAUNCHER`

to 1. If breakpoints are unable to be hit, try setting this environment variable before starting your application.

##
13.14. Debugging on Windows Subsystem for Linux[](https://docs.nvidia.com#debugging-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux)

If you are unable to use the debugger on Windows Subsystem for Linux, make sure the debug interface is enabled by setting the registry key `>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\GPUDebugger\EnableInterface`

to `(DWORD) 1`


##
13.15. Accessing unmanaged device memory from host thread[](https://docs.nvidia.com#accessing-unmanaged-device-memory-from-host-thread)

Special consideration is necessary when accessing unmanaged device memory that was created via the CUDA memory allocation APIs. Consider the following:

```
CUdeviceptr d_global;
cuMemAlloc(&d_global, sizeof(uint32_t));
uint32_t h_global_32 = 0x1234;
cuMemcpyHtoD(d_global, &h_global, sizeof(uint32_t));
```

When examining the contents of `d_global`

directly while focused on a host thread, we will observe incorrect values:

```
(cuda-gdb) print /x *d_global
$1 = 0x0
```

Users are required to explicitly type cast to the correct address space identifier to examine the unmanaged memory on the device:

```
(cuda-gdb) print *(@global unsigned long long *)d_global
$2 = 0x1234
```

When focused on a CUDA thread, explicit casts are unnecessary.

#
14. Supported Platforms[](https://docs.nvidia.com#supported-platforms)

**Host Platform Requirements**

CUDA-GDB is supported on all the platforms supported by the CUDA toolkit with which it is shipped. See the [CUDA Toolkit release notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html) for more information.

**GPU Requirements**

Debugging is supported on all CUDA-capable GPUs supported by the current CUDA release.

**GDB Python integration**

GDB Python integration is supported in cuda-gdb with a multiple builds mechanism in order to support multiple python3 interpreters across different platforms. The cuda-gdb program is a shell script that selects the associated supported cuda-gdb binary based on the version of python available on the system. Support exists for the following Python versions: `Python 3.8`

, `Python 3.9`

, `Python 3.10`

15. Common Issues on Supported Operating Systems[](https://docs.nvidia.com#common-issues-on-supported-operating-systems)

The following are known issues with the current release on supported operating systems and how to fix them.

**Python not initialized**

This happens due to a missing Python 3.x library on the machine, installing it fixes the issue. This can also be caused by having a mismatched major.minor version of libpython installed with the default python3 interpreter in PATH. A libpython version matching the default python3 interpreter in PATH must be available. The libpython version can be determined with the `python3 --version`

command. For example, the following command would tell us that a libpython3.8.so* needs to be installed in a default library search path:

```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.8.10
```

Specific commands to install the proper libpython are below.

**RHEL 8/9**-
`$ sudo yum -y install python3-libs`

**Debian 10/11/12**-
`$ sudo apt-get -y install libpython3-stdlib`

**Fedora 39**-
`$ sudo yum -y install python3-libs`

**OpenSUSE 15**-
`$ sudo zypper install -y libpython3`

**Ubuntu 20.04/22.04**-
`$ sudo apt-get -y install python3.8`

`$ sudo apt-get -y install libpython3.8`

16. Known Issues[](https://docs.nvidia.com#known-issues)

The following are known issues with the current release.

Attaching is not supported on WSL with CUDA 13.1+, it will be re-enabled in a future release.

Debugging on driver 580+ with confidential compute enabled is unstable. Coredump generation is expected to work.

Setting a breakpoint on a line within a

`__device__`

or`__global__`

function before its module is loaded may result in the breakpoint being temporarily set on the first line of a function below in the source code. As soon as the module for the targeted function is loaded, the breakpoint will be reset properly. In the meantime, the breakpoint may be hit, depending on the application. In those situations, the breakpoint can be safely ignored, and the application can be resumed.The

*scheduler-locking*option cannot be set to*on*.Stepping again after stepping out of a kernel results in undetermined behavior. It is recommended to use the ‘continue’ command instead.

Attaching to a CUDA application on QNX is not supported.

Attaching to a CUDA application running in MPS client mode is not supported.

Attaching to the MPS server process (nvidia-cuda-mps-server) using cuda-gdb, or starting the MPS server with cuda-gdb is not supported.

Attaching to a CUDA application that has checkpointed is not supported.

Attaching to a CUDA application that’s using a device that has watchdog enabled is not supported.

Attaching to CUDA in Graphics (CIG) applications and generating coredumps for those applications is not supported.

If a CUDA application is started in the MPS client mode with cuda-gdb, the MPS client will wait until all other MPS clients have terminated, and will then run as non-MPS application.

Significant performance degradation will occur when the debugger steps over inlined routines.


Because inlined code blocks may have multiple exit points, under the hood, the debugger steps every single instruction until an exit point is reached, which incurs considerable cost for large routines. The following actions are recommended to avoid this problem:

Avoid using

`__forceinline__`

when declaring a function. (For code is compiled with debug information, only routines declared with the`__forceinline__`

keyword are actually inlined)Use the

`until <line#>`

command to step over inlined subroutines.On Jetson, calls to the cuda API might result in the debugger jumping to _dl_catch_exception(). A workaround is to continue.

On Jetson and Drive devices GPU debugging works correctly only if the debugger is run with the root permissions. Changes to devfs node permissions are required for the debugger to work without running as root.

Debugger can miss reporting an induced trap(

`__trap()`

) in case it is the next instruction executed after the device resumes from a breakpoint.Debugger can miss reporting breakpoints or exceptions during resume in case new warps are launched on a previously empty SM.

Debugger uses the libpython installed on the system. Use of Python scripting functionality will expose cuda-gdb to the same vulnerabilities as those in the system libpython version. It is recommended to always keep the system libpython library up-to-date.

Debugger doesn’t support accesses to shared memory allocations that are imported from other processes using the CUDA IPC APIs. Attempts to access these shared memory allocations by the debugger will result in an error stating access to memory allocations shared via IPC is not supported.

`break_on_launch`

will not function with OptiX/RTCore programs unless`OPTIX_FORCE_DEPRECATED_LAUNCHER`

is set to`1`

.On QNX, setting the

`QNX_TARGET`

environment variable to point at the target rootfs is required. If this is unavailable, set the environment variable to an empty string.On QNX, debugger doesn’t support running a CUDA application with the

`run`

command more than once. A new`cuda-gdbserver`

process should be started on the QNX target every time`run`

is used to run and debug a CUDA application.
