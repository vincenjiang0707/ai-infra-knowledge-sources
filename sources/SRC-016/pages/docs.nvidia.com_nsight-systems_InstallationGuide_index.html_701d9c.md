# Installation Guide[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#installation-guide)

NVIDIA Nsight Systems installation guide.

## Overview[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#overview)

Nsight Systems is a statistical sampling profiler with tracing features. It is designed to work with devices and devkits based on NVIDIA Tegra SoCs (system-on-chip), Arm SBSA (server based system architecture) systems, Arm Windows systems, and systems based on the x86_64 processor architecture that also include NVIDIA GPU(s).

Throughout this document we will refer to the device on which profiling happens
as the **target**, and the computer on which the user works and controls the
profiling session as the **host**. Note that for x86_64 based systems these may
be on the same device, whereas with Tegra or Arm based systems they will always
be separate.

Furthermore, three different activities are distinguished as follows:

**Profiling**— The process of collecting any performance data. A profiling session in Nsight Systems typically includes sampling and tracing.**Sampling**— The process of periodically stopping the*profilee*(the application under investigation during the profiling session), typically to collect backtraces (call stacks of active threads), which allows you to understand statistically how much time is spent in each function. Additionally, hardware counters can also be sampled. This process is inherently imprecise when a low number of samples have been collected.**Tracing**— The process of collecting precise information about various activities happening in the profilee or in the system. For example, profilee API execution may be traced providing the exact time and duration of a function call.

Nsight Systems supports multiple generations of Tegra SoCs, NVIDIA discrete GPUs, and various CPU architectures, as well as various target and host operating systems. This documentation describes the full set of features available in any version of Nsight Systems. In the event that a feature is not available in all versions, that will be noted in the text. In general, Nsight Systems Embedded Platforms Edition indicates the package that supports Tegra processors for the embedded and automotive market and Nsight Systems Workstation Edition supports x86_64, Arm server (SBSA), and Arm Windows processors for the workstation, cluster, and cloud markets.

Common features that are supported by Nsight Systems on most platforms include the following:

Sampling of the profilee and collecting backtraces using multiple algorithms (such as frame pointers or DWARF data). Building top-down, bottom-up, and flat views as appropriate. This information helps identify performance bottlenecks in CPU-intensive code.

Sampling or tracing system power behaviors, such as CPU frequency.

(Only on Nsight Systems Embedded Platforms Edition)Sampling counters from Arm PMU (Performance Monitoring Unit). Information such as cache misses gets statistically correlated with function execution.

Support for multiple windows. Users with multiple monitors can see multiple reports simultaneously, or have multiple views into the same report file.


With Nsight Systems, a user could:

Identify call paths that monopolize the CPU.

Identify individual functions that monopolize the CPU (across different call paths).

For Nsight Systems Embedded Platforms Edition, identify functions that have poor cache utilization.

If platform supports CUDA, see visual representation of CUDA Runtime and Driver API calls, as well as CUDA GPU workload. Nsight Systems uses the CUDA Profiling Tools Interface (CUPTI), for more information, see:

[CUPTI documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cupti/index.html).If the user annotates with NVIDIA Tools Extension (NVTX), see visual representation of NVTX annotations: ranges, markers, and thread names.

For Windows targets, see visual representation of D3D12: which API calls are being made on the CPU, graphic frames, stutter analysis, as well as GPU workloads (command lists and debug ranges).

For x86_64 targets, see visual representation of Vulkan: which API calls are being made on the CPU, graphic frames, stutter analysis, as well as Vulkan GPU workloads (command buffers and debug ranges).


## System Requirements[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#system-requirements)

Nsight Systems supports multiple platforms. For simplicity, think of these as Nsight Systems Embedded Platforms Edition and Nsight Systems Workstation Edition, where Nsight Systems Workstation Edition supports desktops, workstations, clusters, and clouds with x86_64 or Arm SBSA CPUs on Linux and x86_64 or Arm CPUs on Windows, while Nsight Systems Embedded Platforms Edition supports NVIDIA Tegra products for the embedded and gaming space on Linux for Tegra and QNX OSs.

For information about which drivers were specifically released with each toolkit,
see [CUDA Toolkit Release Notes - Major Component Versions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html#cuda-major-component-versions)

### Requirements for x86_64 and Arm SBSA Targets on Linux[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#requirements-for-x86-64-and-arm-sbsa-targets-on-linux)

When attaching to x86_64 or Arm SBSA Linux-based target from the GUI on the host, the connection is established through SSH.

**Use of Linux Perf**: To collect thread scheduling data and IP (instruction
pointer) samples, the Linux operating system’s `perf_event_paranoid`

level
must be 2 or less. Use the following command to check:

cat /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid

If the output is >2, then do the following to temporarily adjust the paranoid level (note that this has to be done after each reboot):

sudo sh -c 'echo 2 >/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid'

To make the change permanent, use the following command:

sudo sh -c 'echo kernel.perf_event_paranoid=2 > /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf'

**Kernel version**: To collect thread scheduling data and IP (instruction
pointer) samples and backtraces, the kernel version must be:

3.10.0-693 or later for CentOS and RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.4+

4.3 or greater for all other distros including Ubuntu


To check the version number of the kernel on a target device, run the following command on the device:

uname -a

Note

Only CentOS, RedHat, and Ubuntu distros are tested/confirmed to work correctly.

**glibc version**: To check the glibc version on a target device, run the
following command:

ldd --version

Nsight Systems requires glibc 2.17 or newer.

**CUDA**: See above for supported CUDA versions in this release. Use the
deviceQuery command to determine the CUDA driver and runtime versions on the
system. The deviceQuery command is available in the CUDA SDK. It is normally
installed at:

/usr/local/cuda/samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery

Only pure 64-bit environments are supported. In other words, 32-bit systems or 32-bit processes running within a 64-bit environment are not supported.

Nsight Systems requires write permission to the `/var/lock`

directory on the
target system.

**Docker**: See Container Support section of the User Guide for
more information.

## Getting Started Guide[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#getting-started-guide)

### Finding the Right Package[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#finding-the-right-package)

Nsight Systems is available for multiple targets and multiple host OSs. To choose the right package, first consider the target system to be analyzed.

For Tegra target systems, select Nsight Systems Embedded Platforms Edition available as part of

[NVIDIA JetPack SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack). For older Tegra targets, see[NVIDIA JetPack Archives](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-archive).For x86_64 or Arm SBSA select from the target packages from Nsight Systems Workstation Edition, available from

[https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems). This web release will always contain the latest and greatest Nsight Systems features.For Arm Windows select the x86_64 Windows package from Nsight Systems Workstation Edition, which contains the Arm Windows target.

The x86_64 and Arm SBSA target versions of Nsight Systems are also available in the

[CUDA Toolkit.](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

Each package is limited to one architecture. For example, Tegra packages do not contain support for profiling x86 targets, and x86 packages do not contain support for profiling Tegra targets.

After choosing an appropriate target version, select the package corresponding to the host OS, the OS on the system where results will be viewed. These packages are in the form of common installer types: .msi for Windows; .run, .rpm, and .deb for x86 Linux; and .dmg for the macOS installer.

**Tegra packages**

Windows host - Install .msi on Windows machine. Enables remote access to Tegra device for profiling.

Linux host - Install .run on Linux system. Enables remote access to Tegra device for profiling.

macOS host - Install .dmg on macOS machine. Enables remote access to Tegra device for profiling.


**x86_64 packages**

Windows host - Install .msi on Windows machine. Enables remote access to Linux x86_64 or Windows devices for profiling as well as running on local system.

Linux host - Install .run, .rpm, or .deb on Linux system. Enables remote access to Linux x86_64 or Windows devices for profiling or running collection on localhost.

Linux CLI only - The Linux CLI is shipped in all x86 packages, but if you just want the CLI, we have a package for that. Install .deb or .rpm on Linux system. Enables only CLI collection, report can be imported or opened in x86_64 host.

macOS host - Install .dmg on macOS machine. Enables remote access to Linux x86_64 device for profiling.


**Arm SBSA packages**

Arm SBSA host - Install .run, .rpm, or .deb on Arm SBSA system. Enables profiling and report viewing on local system.

Arm SBSA CLI only - The Arm SBSA CLI is shipped in all host packages, but if you just want the CLI, we have a package for that. Install .deb or .rpm on Arm SBSA system. Enables only CLI collection, report can be imported or opened in GUI on any supported host platform.


**Arm Windows packages**

Windows host - Install the x86_64 Windows .msi on Windows machine. Enables remote access to Arm & x86_64 Windows devices for profiling as well as running on the local system.


Note

On Windows machines we recommend installing Nsight Systems to the default secure location under Program Files.

### Package Manager Installation[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#package-manager-installation)

Installation using RPM or Debian packages interfaces with your system’s package management system. When using RPM or Debian local repo installers, the downloaded package contains a repository snapshot stored on the local filesystem in /var/. Such a package only informs the package manager where to find the actual installation packages, but will not install them.

If the online network repository is enabled, RPM or Debian packages will be automatically downloaded at installation time using the package manager: apt-get, dnf, yum, or zypper.

Users can download Nsight Systems (full package **nsight-systems** or CLI-only
package **nsight-systems-cli**) from publicly available repositories. The below
commands are given as examples and are not intended to be precisely correct.

**Ubuntu (minimal setup for containers)**

These instructions assume that you have root in the container. Example
command to launch a container: `sudo docker run -it --rm ubuntu:latest bash`


```
apt update
apt install -y --no-install-recommends gnupg2 wget ca-certificates
wget -O- https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub \
| gpg --dearmor \
| tee /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-devtools-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-devtools-keyring.gpg] \
https://developer.download.nvidia.com/devtools/repos/ubuntu$(source /etc/lsb-release; echo "$DISTRIB_RELEASE" | tr -d .)/$(dpkg --print-architecture)/ /" \
| tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-devtools.list
apt update
apt install nsight-systems-cli
```

**Ubuntu (desktop)**

```
sudo apt install gnupg2 wget ca-certificates
wget -O- https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub \
| gpg --dearmor \
| sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-devtools-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-devtools-keyring.gpg] \
https://developer.download.nvidia.com/devtools/repos/ubuntu$(source /etc/lsb-release; echo "$DISTRIB_RELEASE" | tr -d .)/$(dpkg --print-architecture)/ /" \
| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-devtools.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nsight-systems
```

**CentOS and RHEL (minimal setup for containers)**

Same as above for Ubuntu, these instructions assume that you have root in the
container. Example command to launch a container:
`sudo docker run -it --rm rockylinux:9 bash`


```
rpm --import https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub
dnf install -y 'dnf-command(config-manager)'
dnf config-manager --add-repo "https://developer.download.nvidia.com/devtools/repos/rhel$(source /etc/os-release; echo ${VERSION_ID%%.*})/$(rpm --eval '%{_arch}' | sed s/aarch/arm/)/"
dnf install -y nsight-systems-cli
```

**CentOS and RHEL (desktop)**

```
sudo rpm --import https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub
sudo dnf install -y 'dnf-command(config-manager)'
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo "https://developer.download.nvidia.com/devtools/repos/rhel$(source /etc/os-release; echo ${VERSION_ID%%.*})/$(rpm --eval '%{_arch}' | sed s/aarch/arm/)/"
sudo dnf install nsight-systems
```

### Installing GUI on the Host System[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#installing-gui-on-the-host-system)

Copy the appropriate file to your host system in a directory where you have write and execute permissions. Run the install file, accept the EULA, and Nsight Systems will install on your system.

On Linux, there are special options to enable automated installation. Running the installer with the `--accept`

flag will automatically accept the EULA, running with the `--accept`

flag and the `--quiet`

flag will automatically accept the EULA without printing to stdout. Running with `--quiet`

without `--accept`

will display an error.

The installation will create a Host directory for this host and a Target directory for each target this Nsight Systems package supports.

All binaries needed to collect data on a target device will be installed on the target by the host on first connection to the device. There is no need to install the package on the target device.

If installing from the CUDA Toolkit, see the [CUDA Toolkit documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/).

### Optional: Setting up the CLI[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#optional-setting-up-the-cli)

All Nsight Systems targets can be profiled using the CLI. Arm SBSA targets can only be profiled using the CLI. The CLI is especially helpful when scripts are used to run unattended collections or when access to the target system via ssh is not possible. In particular, this can be used to enable collection in a Docker container.

The CLI can be found in the Target directory of the Nsight Systems installation. Users who want to install the CLI as a standalone tool can do so by copying the files within the Target directory to the location of their choice.

If you wish to run the CLI without root (recommended mode) you will want to install in a directory where you have full access.

Once you have the CLI set up, you can use the `nsys status -e`

command to
check your environment.

```
~$ nsys status -e
Sampling Environment Check
Linux Kernel Paranoid Level = 1: OK
Linux Distribution = Ubuntu
Linux Kernel Version = 4.15.0-109-generic: OK
Linux perf_event_open syscall available: OK
Sampling trigger event available: OK
Intel(c) Last Branch Record support: Available
Sampling Environment: OK
```

This status check allows you to ensure that the system requirements for CPU sampling using Nsight Systems are met in your local environment. If the Sampling Environment is not OK, you will still be able to run various trace operations.

Intel(c) Last Branch Record allows tools, including Nsight Systems to use hardware to quickly get limited stack information. Nsight Systems will use this method for stack resolution by default if available.

For information about changing these environment settings, see System Requirements section in the Installation Guide. For information about changing the backtrace method, see Profiling from the CLI in the User Guide.

To get started using the CLI, run `nsys --help`

for a list of options or see
Profiling Applications from the CLI in the User Guide for full documentation.

### Launching the GUI[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#launching-the-gui)

Depending on your OS, Nsight Systems will have installed an icon on your host desktop that you can use to launch the GUI. To launch the GUI directly, run the `nsys-ui`

executable in the Host sub-directory of your installation.

### Installing Advanced Analysis System[#](https://docs.nvidia.com#installing-advanced-analysis-system)

The Nsight Systems advanced analysis system is located in the appropriate
`<install-dir>/target-<os>-<arch>/python/packages/nsys_recipe`

directory for
your operating system and architecture.

**Recipe Dependencies**

The system is written in Python and depends on a set of Python packages. The prerequisites are Python 3.10 or newer with pip and venv.

Starting with Nsight Systems 2026.3.1, the analysis system executes using the version of Python that is bundled with the Nsight Systems installation (currently Python 3.12.12). The first time you run the analysis system, it installs the required Python packages into a virtual environment within your local directory in the following locations depending on your operating system:

Linux:

`~/.nsightsystems/venv`

Windows:

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\NVIDIA Nsight Systems\venv`

macOS: Recipe analysis will be supported in a future release, once the Nsys CLI is supported on macOS.


The virtual environment is created with the dependencies needed for the current analysis script.
Some recipes may require additional dependencies, which automatically trigger additional
installation steps. For example, if the analysis script requires the `dask`

package, the analysis system
automatically installs the `dask`

package into the virtual environment. The installation can
sometimes take a few minutes to complete, so be patient. You can monitor the installation progress
by viewing the `recipe_dependencies_install_log.txt`

file in the current working directory.

**Advanced usage: Custom Python Environment**

If you want to use a different version of Python than the one that is bundled with Nsight Systems, you can create a virtual environment with the desired version of Python and install the required Python packages into it. Consult the Python documentation for more information on how to create a virtual environment.

For this to work, you must set the `NSYSPYTHONEXE`

environment variable to point to
the Python executable in the custom Python environment:

```
export NSYSPYTHONEXE=/path/to/python_executable
```

You can then install the required Python packages into the custom Python environment using
the `install.py`

script provided with Nsight Systems. The `install.py`

script automates the installation of the analysis system recipe dependencies. You must select
one of the following options when you run the script:
`--current`

, `--venv PATH`

, or `--download`

. Additionally, use `--offline`

with `--current`

or `--venv`

to install from previously downloaded packages.

```
<install-dir>/target-<os>-<arch>/python/packages/nsys_recipe/install.py
```

Options:

`-h`

: Display help`--current`

: Install packages in the current environment. If a venv is active, packages will be installed there. Otherwise, packages will be installed in the system site-packages directory, which enables usage of`nsys recipe`

without having to activate a virtual environment. However, new packages risk colliding with existing ones if different versions are required.`--venv PATH`

: Install packages in a virtual environment. If the venv doesn’t already exist, it is created. Using a venv prevents the risk of package version collision in the current environment.`--download`

: Download wheel packages for offline installation`--offline`

: Install packages from downloaded wheels (offline mode)`--no-jupyter`

: Do not install requirements for the Jupyter notebook`--no-dask`

: Do not install requirements for Dask`--quiet`

: Only display errors

For example, to install the minimum required Python packages for the analysis system into the currently active virtual environment, you can run the following command:

```
<install-dir>/target-<os>-<arch>/python/packages/nsys_recipe/install.py --current --no-dask --no-jupyter
```

**Jupyter Notebook**

The Nsight Systems UI has the ability to load and display Jupyter notebooks. When you open a Jupyter notebook,
the UI first attempts to launch the JupyterLab server using the default Python environment on your `$PATH`

.
If that fails, the UI will attempt to launch JupyterLab using the Nsight Systems Python environment,
creating the venv if necessary.

Note: macOS users should install JupyterLab into their default Python environment since the Nsys CLI and
`install.py`

script are not currently supported on macOS.

You can also use `NSYSPYTHONEXE`

to run Jupyter from your custom Python environment. This variable should
be set to the path to the Python executable in your custom environment and it will launch JupyterLab using that
environment, like the following command:

```
export NSYSPYTHONEXE=/path/to/python_executable
$NSYSPYTHONEXE -m jupyter lab
```

Alternatively, you may launch JupyterLab independently to view the recipe outside of the Nsight Systems UI using:

```
jupyter lab <path-to-notebook>
```
