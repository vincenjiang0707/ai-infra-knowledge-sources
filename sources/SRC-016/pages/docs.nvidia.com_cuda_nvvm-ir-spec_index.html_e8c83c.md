NVVM IR Specification

Reference guide to the NVVM compiler (intermediate representation) based on the LLVM IR.

#
1. Introduction[](https://docs.nvidia.com#introduction)

NVVM IR is a compiler IR (intermediate representation) based on the LLVM IR. The NVVM IR is designed to represent GPU compute kernels (for example, CUDA kernels). High-level language front-ends, like the CUDA C compiler front-end, can generate NVVM IR. The NVVM compiler (which is based on LLVM) generates PTX code from NVVM IR.

NVVM IR and NVVM compilers are mostly agnostic about the source language being used. The PTX codegen part of a NVVM compiler needs to know the source language because of the difference in DCI (driver/compiler interface).

NVVM IR is a binary format and is based on a subset of LLVM IR bitcode format. This document uses only human-readable form to describe NVVM IR.

Technically speaking, NVVM IR is LLVM IR with a set of rules, restrictions, and conventions, plus a set of supported intrinsic functions. A program specified in NVVM IR is always a legal LLVM program. A legal LLVM program may not be a legal NVVM program.

There are three levels of support for NVVM IR.

Supported: The feature is fully supported. Most IR features should fall into this category.

Accepted and ignored: The NVVM compiler will accept this IR feature, but will ignore the required semantics. This applies to some IR features that do not have meaningful semantics on GPUs and that can be ignored. Calling convention markings are an example.

Illegal, not supported: The specified semantics is not supported, such as a

`fence`

instruction. Future versions of NVVM may either support or accept and ignore IRs that are illegal in the current version.

This document describes version 2.0 of the NVVM IR and version 3.1 of the NVVM
debug metadata (see [Source Level Debugging Support](https://docs.nvidia.com#source-level-debugging-support)). The 2.0 version of
NVVM IR is incompatible with the previous version 1.11. Linking of NVVM IR
Version 1.11 with 2.0 will result in compiler error.

NVVM IR can be in one of two dialects. The LLVM 7 dialect is based on LLVM
7.0.1. The modern dialect is based on a more recent public release version of
LLVM (LLVM 22.1.0). The modern dialect only supports Blackwell and later
architectures (compute capability `compute_100`

or greater). For the
complete semantics of the IR, readers of this document should refer to either
the official LLVM Language Reference Manual [version 7](https://releases.llvm.org/7.0.1/docs/LangRef.html) or [version 22](https://releases.llvm.org/22.1.0/docs/LangRef.html). This document is
annotated with notes when differences between the two NVVM IR dialects are
important.

#
2. Identifiers[](https://docs.nvidia.com#identifiers)

The name of a named global identifier must have the form:

`@[a-zA-Z$_][a-zA-Z$_0-9]*`


Note that it cannot contain the . character.

`[@%]llvm.nvvm.*`

and `[@%]nvvm.*`

are reserved words.

#
3. High Level Structure[](https://docs.nvidia.com#high-level-structure)

##
3.1. Linkage Types[](https://docs.nvidia.com#linkage-types)

Supported:

`private`

`internal`

`available_externally`

`linkonce`

`weak`

`common`

`linkonce_odr`

`weak_odr`

`external`


All other linkage types are not supported.

See [NVVM ABI for PTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/index.html#nvvm-abi-for-ptx) for details on how linkage types are translated to PTX.

##
3.2. Calling Conventions[](https://docs.nvidia.com#calling-conventions)

All LLVM calling convention markings are accepted and ignored. Functions and calls are generated according to the PTX calling convention.

###
3.2.1. Rules and Restrictions[](https://docs.nvidia.com#rules-and-restrictions)

When an argument with width less than 32-bit is passed, the

`zeroext/signext`

parameter attribute should be set.`zeroext`

will be assumed if not set.When a value with width less than 32-bit is returned, the

`zeroext/signext`

parameter attribute should be set.`zeroext`

will be assumed if not set.Arguments of aggregate or vector types that are passed by value can be passed by pointer with the

`byval`

attribute set (referred to as the`by-pointer-byval`

case below). The align attribute must be set if the type requires a non-natural alignment (natural alignment is the alignment inferred for the aggregate type according to the[Data Layout](https://docs.nvidia.com/index.html#data-layout)section).If a function has an argument of aggregate or vector type that is passed by value directly and the type has a non-natural alignment requirement, the alignment must be annotated by the global property annotation <

`align`

, alignment>, where alignment is a 32-bit integer whose upper 16 bits represent the argument position (starting from 1) and the lower 16 bits represent the alignment.If the return type of a function is an aggregate or a vector that has a non-natural alignment, then the alignment requirement must be annotated by the global property annotation <

`align`

, alignment>, where the upper 16 bits is 0, and the lower 16 bits represent the alignment.It is not required to annotate a function with <

`align`

, alignment> otherwise. If annotated, the alignment must match the natural alignment or the align attribute in the`by-pointer-byval`

case.-
For an indirect call instruction of a function that has a non-natural alignment for its return value or one of its arguments that is not expressed in alignment in the

`by-pointer-byval`

case, the call instruction must have an attached metadata of kind`callalign`

. The metadata contains a sequence of`i32`

fields each of which represents a non-natural alignment requirement. The upper 16 bits of an`i32`

field represent the argument position (0 for return value, 1 for the first argument, and so on) and the lower 16 bits represent the alignment. The`i32`

fields must be sorted in the increasing order.For example,

%call = call %struct.S %fp1(%struct.S* byval align 8 %arg1p, %struct.S %arg2),!callalign !10 !10 = !{i32 8, i32 520};

It is not required to have an

`i32`

metadata field for the other arguments or the return value otherwise. If presented, the alignment must match the natural alignment or the align attribute in the`by-pointer-byval case`

.It is not required to have a

`callalign`

metadata attached to a direct call instruction. If attached, the alignment must match the natural alignment or the alignment in the`by-pointer-byval`

case.The absence of the metadata in an indirect call instruction means using natural alignment or the align attribute in the

`by-pointer-byval`

case.

##
3.3. Visibility Styles[](https://docs.nvidia.com#visibility-styles)

The NVVM IR version is specified using a named metadata called `!nvvmir.version`

. The `!nvvmir.version`

named metadata may have one metadata node that contains the NVVM IR version for that module. If multiple such modules are linked together, the named metadata in the linked module may have more than one metadata node with each node containing a version. A metadata node with NVVM IR version takes either of the following forms:

-
It may consist of two i32 values—the first denotes the NVVM IR major version number and the second denotes the minor version number. If absent, the version number is assumed to be 1.0, which can be specified as:

!nvvmir.version = !{!0} !0 = !{i32 1, i32 0}

-
It may consist of four i32 values—the first two denote the NVVM IR major and minor versions respectively. The third value denotes the NVVM IR debug metadata major version number, and the fourth value denotes the corresponding minor version number. If absent, the version number is assumed to be 1.0, which can be specified as:

!nvvmir.version = !{!0} !0 = !{i32 1, i32 0, i32 1, i32 0}

#
12. Address Space[](https://docs.nvidia.com#address-space)

##
12.1. Address Spaces[](https://docs.nvidia.com#address-spaces)

NVVM IR has a set of predefined memory address spaces, whose semantics are similar to those defined in CUDA C/C++, OpenCL C and PTX. Any address space not listed below is not supported .

Name |
Address Space Number |
Semantics/Example |
|---|---|---|
code |
0 |
functions, code
|
generic |
0 |
Can only be used to qualify the pointee of a pointer
|
global |
1 |
|
shared |
3 |
|
constant |
4 |
|
local |
5 |
|
<reserved> |
2, 101 and above |

Each global variable, that is not an intrinsic global variable, can be declared to reside in a specific non-zero address space, which can only be one of the following: `global`

, `shared`

or `constant`

.

If a non-intrinsic global variable is declared without any address space number or with the address space number 0, then this global variable resides in address space `global`

and the pointer of this global variable holds a generic pointer value.

The predefined NVVM memory spaces are needed for the language front-ends to model the memory spaces in the source languages. For example,

```
// CUDA C/C++
__constant__ int c;
__device__ int g;
; NVVM IR
@c = addrspace(4) global i32 0, align 4
@g = addrspace(1) global [2 x i32] zeroinitializer, align 4
```

Address space numbers 2 and 101 or higher are reserved for NVVM compiler internal use only. No language front-end should generate code that uses these address spaces directly.

12.2.1. Generic Pointers vs. Non-generic Pointers[](https://docs.nvidia.com#generic-pointers-vs-non-generic-pointers)

There are generic pointers and non-generic pointers in NVVM IR. A generic pointer is a pointer that may point to memory in any address space. A non-generic pointer points to memory in a specific address space.

In NVVM IR, a generic pointer has a pointer type with the address space `generic`

, while a non-generic pointer has a pointer type with a non-generic address space.

Note that the address space number for the generic address space is 0—the default in both NVVM IR and LLVM IR. The address space number for the code address space is also 0. Function pointers are qualified by address space `code`

(`addrspace(0)`

).

Loads/stores via generic pointers are supported, as well as loads/stores via non-generic pointers. Loads/stores via function pointers are not supported

```
@a = addrspace(1) global i32 0, align 4 ; 'global' addrspace, @a holds a specific value
@b = global i32 0, align 4 ; 'global' addrspace, @b holds a generic value
@c = addrspace(4) global i32 0, align 4 ; 'constant' addrspace, @c holds a specific value
... = load i32 addrspace(1)* @a, align 4 ; Correct
... = load i32* @a, align 4 ; Wrong
... = load i32* @b, align 4 ; Correct
... = load i32 addrspace(1)* @b, align 4 ; Wrong
... = load i32 addrspace(4)* @c, align4 ; Correct
... = load i32* @c, align 4 ; Wrong
```

###
12.2.2. Conversion[](https://docs.nvidia.com#conversion)

The bit value of a generic pointer that points to a specific object may be different from the bit value of a specific pointer that points to the same object.

The `addrspacecast`

IR instruction should be used to perform pointer casts across address spaces (generic to non-generic or non-generic to generic). Casting a non-generic pointer to a different non-generic pointer is not supported. Casting from a generic to a non-generic pointer is undefined if the generic pointer does not point to an object in the target non-generic address space.

`inttoptr`

and `ptrtoint`

are supported. `inttoptr`

and `ptrtoint`

are value preserving instructions when the two operands are of the same size. In general, using `ptrtoint`

and `inttoptr`

to implement an address space cast is undefined.

The following intrinsic can be used to query if the argument pointer was derived from the address of a kernel function parameter that has the grid_constant property:

```
i1 @llvm.nvvm.isspacep.grid_const(i8*)
```

The following intrinsic can be used to query if the input generic pointer was derived from the address of a variable allocated in the shared address space, in a CTA that is part of the same cluster as the parent CTA of the invoking thread. This intrinsic is only supported for Hopper+.

```
i1 @llvm.nvvm.isspacep.cluster_shared(i8*)
```

The following intrinsics can be used to query if a generic pointer can be safely cast to a specific non-generic address space:

`i1 @llvm.nvvm.isspacep.const(i8*)`

`i1 @llvm.nvvm.isspacep.global(i8*)`

`i1 @llvm.nvvm.isspacep.local(i8*)`

`i1 @llvm.nvvm.isspacep.shared(i8*)`


`bitcast`

on pointers is supported, though LLVM IR forbids `bitcast`

from being used to change the address space of a pointer.

###
12.2.3. No Aliasing between Two Different Specific Address Spaces[](https://docs.nvidia.com#no-aliasing-between-two-different-specific-address-spaces)

Two different specific address spaces do not overlap. NVVM compiler assumes two memory accesses via non-generic pointers that point to different address spaces are not aliased.

##
12.3. The alloca Instruction[](https://docs.nvidia.com#the-alloca-instruction)

The `alloca`

instruction returns a generic pointer that only points to address space `local`

.

#
13. Global Property Annotation[](https://docs.nvidia.com#global-property-annotation)

##
13.1. Overview[](https://docs.nvidia.com#overview)

NVVM uses Named Metadata to annotate IR objects with properties that are otherwise not representable in the IR. The NVVM IR producers can use the Named Metadata to annotate the IR with properties, which the NVVM compiler can process.

##
13.2. Representation of Properties[](https://docs.nvidia.com#representation-of-properties)

For each translation unit (that is, per bitcode file), there is a named metadata called `nvvm.annotations`

.

This named metadata contains a list of MDNodes.

The first operand of each MDNode is an entity that the node is annotating using the remaining operands.

Multiple MDNodes may provide annotations for the same entity, in which case their first operands will be same.

The remaining operands of the MDNode are organized in order as <property-name, value>.

The property-name operand is MDString, while the value is

`i32`

.Starting with the operand after the annotated entity, every alternate operand specifies a property.

-
The operand after a property is its value.

The following is an example.

!nvvm.annotations = !{!12, !13} !12 = !{void (i32, i32)* @_Z6kernelii, !"kernel", i32 1} !13 = !{void ()* @_Z7kernel2v, !"kernel", i32 1, !"maxntidx", i32 16}


If two bitcode files are being linked and both have a named metadata `nvvm.annotations`

, the linked file will have a single merged named metadata. If both files define properties for the same entity foo , the linked file will have two MDNodes defining properties for foo . It is illegal for the files to have conflicting properties for the same entity.

##

14. Texture and Surface[](https://docs.nvidia.com#texture-and-surface)

##
14.1. Texture Variable and Surface Variable[](https://docs.nvidia.com#texture-variable-and-surface-variable)

A texture or a surface variable can be declared/defined as a global variable of `i64`

type with annotation `texture`

or `surface`

in the `global`

address space.

A texture or surface variable must have a name, which must follow identifier naming conventions.

It is illegal to store to or load from the address of a texture or surface variable. A texture or a surface variable may only have the following uses:

In a metadata node

As an intrinsic function argument as shown below

In

`llvm.used`

Global Variable

##
14.2. Accessing Texture Memory or Surface Memory[](https://docs.nvidia.com#accessing-texture-memory-or-surface-memory)

Texture memory and surface memory can be accessed using texture or surface handles. NVVM provides the following intrinsic function to get a texture or surface handle from a texture or surface variable.

```
delcare i64 %llvm.nvvm.texsurf.handle.p1i64(metadata, i64 addrspace(1)*)
```

The first argument to the intrinsic is a metadata holding the texture or surface variable. Such a metadata may hold only one texture or one surface variable. The second argument to the intrinsic is the texture or surface variable itself. The intrinsic returns a handle of `i64`

type.

The returned handle value from the intrinsic call can be used as an operand (with a constraint of l) in a PTX inline asm to access the texture or surface memory.

15.5.2. Surface Loads[](https://docs.nvidia.com#surface-loads)

In the following intrinsics, `<clamp>`

represents the surface clamp mode and can be one of the following: `clamp`

, `trap`

, or `zero`

.

For surface load instructions that operate on 8-bit data channels, the output operands are of type `i16`

. The high-order eight bits are undefined.

15.6. Warp-level Operations[](https://docs.nvidia.com#warp-level-operations)

###
15.6.1. Barrier Synchronization[](https://docs.nvidia.com#barrier-synchronization)

The following intrinsic performs a barrier synchronization among a subset of threads in a warp.

```
declare void @llvm.nvvm.bar.warp.sync(i32 %membermask)
```

This intrinsic causes executing thread to wait until all threads corresponding to `%membermask`

have executed the same intrinsic with the same `%membermask`

value before resuming execution.

The argument `%membership`

is a 32bit mask, with each bit corresponding to a lane in the warp. 1 means the thread is in the subset.

The behavior of this intrinsic is undefined if the executing thread is not in the `%membermask`

.

###
15.6.2. Data Movement[](https://docs.nvidia.com#data-movement)

The following intrinsics synchronize a subset of threads in a warp and then perform data movement among these threads.
Note that the old intrinsic with the `%mode`

parameter is deprecated on the modern NVVM IR dialect.

```
; New intrinsics for the modern dialect
declare {i32, i1} @llvm.nvvm.shfl.sync.idx.i32p(i32 %membermask, i32 %a, i32 %b, i32 %c)
declare {i32, i1} @llvm.nvvm.shfl.sync.up.i32p(i32 %membermask, i32 %a, i32 %b, i32 %c)
declare {i32, i1} @llvm.nvvm.shfl.sync.down.i32p(i32 %membermask, i32 %a, i32 %b, i32 %c)
declare {i32, i1} @llvm.nvvm.shfl.sync.bfly.i32p(i32 %membermask, i32 %a, i32 %b, i32 %c)
; Old intrinsic for the LLVM 7 dialect
declare {i32, i1} @llvm.nvvm.shfl.sync.i32(i32 %membermask, i32 %mode, i32 %a, i32 %b, i32 %c)
```

This intrinsic causes executing thread to wait until all threads corresponding to `%membermask`

have executed the same intrinsic with the same `%membermask`

value before reading data from other threads in the same warp.

The argument `%membership`

is a 32bit mask, with each bit corresponding to a lane in the warp. 1 means the thread is in the subset.

Each thread in the currently executing warp will compute a source lane index j based on input arguments `%b`

, `%c`

, and the shuffle mode (implicit for new intrinsics, explicit via %mode for the old intrinsic). If the computed source lane index j is in range, the returned `i32`

value will be the value of `%a`

from lane j; otherwise, it will be the the value of `%a`

from the current thread. If the thread corresponding to lane j is inactive, then the returned `i32`

value is undefined. The returned `i1`

value is set to 1 if the source lane j is in range, and otherwise set to 0.

In the LLVM 7 dialect intrinsic, the argument `%mode`

must be a constant and its encoding is specified in the following table.

Encoding |
Meaning |
Corresponding Suffix |
|---|---|---|
0 |
IDX |
.idx |
1 |
UP |
.up |
2 |
DOWN |
.down |
3 |
BFLY |
.bfly |

Argument `%b`

specifies a source lane or source lane offset, depending on `%mode`

.

Argument `%c`

contains two packed values specifying a mask for logically splitting warps into sub-segments and an upper bound for clamping the source lane index.

The following pseudo code illustrates the semantics of this intrinsic. The `%mode`

in the switch would be determined by the intrinsic suffix in the modern dialect intrinsics
and by the `%mode`

parameter in the LLVM 7 dialect intrinsic.

```
wait until all threads in %membermask have arrived;
%lane[4:0] = current_lane_id; // position of thread in warp
%bval[4:0] = %b[4:0]; // source lane or lane offset (0..31)
%cval[4:0] = %c[4:0]; // clamp value
%mask[4:0] = %c[12:8];
%maxLane = (%lane[4:0] & %mask[4:0]) | (%cval[4:0] & ~%mask[4:0]);
%minLane = (%lane[4:0] & %mask[4:0]);
switch (%mode) {
case UP: %j = %lane - %bval; %pval = (%j >= %maxLane); break;
case DOWN: %j = %lane + %bval; %pval = (%j <= %maxLane); break;
case BFLY: %j = %lane ^ %bval; %pval = (%j <= %maxLane); break;
case IDX: %j = %minLane | (%bval[4:0] & ~%mask[4:0]); %pval = (%j <= %maxLane); break;
}
if (!%pval) %j = %lane; // copy from own lane
if (thread at lane %j is active)
%d = %a from lane %j
else
%d = undef
return {%d, %pval}
```

Note that the return values are undefined if the thread at the source lane is not in `%membermask`

.

The behavior of this intrinsic is undefined if the executing thread is not in the `%membermask`

.

###
15.6.3. Vote[](https://docs.nvidia.com#vote)

The following intrinsic synchronizes a subset of threads in a warp and then performs a reduce-and-broadcast of a predicate over all threads in the subset.

```
declare {i32, i1} @llvm.nvvm.vote.sync(i32 %membermask, i32 %mode, i1 %predicate)
```

This intrinsic causes executing thread to wait until all threads corresponding to `%membermask`

have executed the same intrinsic with the same `%membermask`

value before performing a reduce-and-broadcast of a predicate over all threads in the subset.

The argument `%membermask`

is a 32-bit mask, with each bit corresponding to a lane in the warp. 1 means the thread is in the subset.

`@llvm.nvvm.vote.sync()`

performs a reduction of the source `%predicate`

across all threads in `%membermask`

after the synchronization. The return value is the same across all threads in the `%membermask`

. The element in the returned aggregate that holds the return value depends on `%mode`

.

The argument `%mode`

must be a constant and its encoding is specified in the following table.

Encoding |
Meaning |
return value |
|---|---|---|
0 |
ALL |
|
1 |
ANY |
|
2 |
EQ |
|
3 |
BALLOT |
|

For the `BALLOT`

mode, the `i32`

value represents the ballot data, which contains the `%predicate`

value from each thread in `%membermask`

in the bit position corresponding to the thread’s land id. The bit value corresponding to a thread not in `%membermask`

is 0.

Note that the return values are undefined if the thread at the source lane is not in `%membermask`

.

The behavior of this intrinsic is undefined if the executing thread is not in the `%membermask`

.

###
15.6.4. Match[](https://docs.nvidia.com#match)

The following intrinsics synchronize a subset of threads in a warp and then broadcast and compare a value across threads in the subset.

```
declare i32 @llvm.nvvm.match.any.sync.i32(i32 %membermask, i32 %value)
declare i32 @llvm.nvvm.match.any.sync.i64(i32 %membermask, i64 %value)
declare {i32, i1} @llvm.nvvm.match.all.sync.i32(i32 %membermask, i32 %value)
declare {i32, i1} @llvm.nvvm.match.all.sync.i64(i32 %membermask, i64 %value)
```

These intrinsics cause executing thread to wait until all threads corresponding to `%membermask`

have executed the same intrinsic with the same `%membermask`

value before performing broadcast and compare of operand `%value`

across all threads in the subset.

The argument `%membership`

is a 32bit mask, with each bit corresponding to a lane in the warp. 1 means the thread is in the subset.

The `i32`

return value is a 32-bit mask where bit position in mask corresponds to thread’s laneid.

In the `any`

version, the `i32`

return value is set to the mask of active threads in `%membermask`

that have same value as operand `%value`

.

In the `all`

version, if all active threads in `%membermask`

have same value as operand `%value`

, the `i32`

return value is set to `%membermask`

, and the `i1`

value is set to 1. Otherwise, the `i32`

return value is set to 0 and the `i1`

return value is also set to 0.

The behavior of this intrinsic is undefined if the executing thread is not in the `%membermask`

.

###
15.6.5. Matrix Operation[](https://docs.nvidia.com#matrix-operation)

THIS IS PREVIEW FEATURE. SUPPORT MAY BE REMOVED IN FUTURE RELEASES.

NVVM provides warp-level intrinsics for matrix multiply operations. The core operation is a matrix multiply and accumulate of the form:

```
D = A*B + C, or
C = A*B + C
```

where `A`

is an `MxK`

matrix, `B`

is a `KxN`

matrix, while `C`

and `D`

are `MxN`

matrices. `C`

and `D`

are also called accumulators. The element type of the `A`

and `B`

matrices is 16-bit floating point. The element type of the accumulators can be either 32-bit floating point or 16-bit floating point.

All threads in a warp will collectively hold the contents of each matrix `A`

, `B`

, `C`

and `D`

. Each thread will hold only a fragment of matrix `A`

, a fragment of matrix `B`

, a fragment of matrix `C`

, and a fragment of the result matrix `D`

. How the elements of a matrix are distributed among the fragments is opaque to the user and is different for matrix `A`

, `B`

and the accumulator.

A fragment is represented by a sequence of element values. For fp32 matrices, the element type is `float`

. For fp16 matrices, the element type is `i32`

(each `i32`

value holds two fp16 values). The number of elements varies with the shape of the matrix.

####
15.6.5.1. Load Fragments[](https://docs.nvidia.com#load-fragments)

The following intrinsics synchronize all threads in a warp and then load a fragment of a matrix for each thread.

```
; load fragment A
declare {i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32} @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m16n16k16.ld.a.p<n>i32(i32 addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol);
declare {i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32} @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m32n8k16.ld.a.p<n>i32(i32 addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol);
declare {i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32} @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m8n32k16.ld.a.p<n>i32(i32 addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol);
; load fragment B
declare {i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32} @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m16n16k16.ld.b.p<n>i32(i32 addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol);
declare {i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32} @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m32n8k16.ld.b.p<n>i32(i32 addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol);
declare {i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32, i32} @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m8n32k16.ld.b.p<n>i32(i32 addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol);
; load fragment C
declare {float, float, float, float, float, float, float, float} @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m16n16k16.ld.c.f32.p<n>f32(float addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol);
declare {float, float, float, float, float, float, float, float} @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m32n8k16.ld.c.f32.p<n>f32(float addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol);
declare {float, float, float, float, float, float, float, float} @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m8n32k16.ld.c.f32.p<n>f32(float addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol);
; load fragment C
declare {i32, i32, i32, i32} @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m16n16k16.ld.c.f16.p<n>i32(i32 addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol);
declare {i32, i32, i32, i32} @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m32n8k16.ld.c.f16.p<n>i32(i32 addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol);
declare {i32, i32, i32, i32} @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m8n32k16.ld.c.f16.p<n>i32(i32 addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol);
```

These intrinsics load and return a matrix fragment from memory at location `%ptr`

. The matrix in memory must be in a canonical matrix layout with leading dimension `%ldm`

. `%rowcol`

specifies which the matrix in memory is row-major (0) or column-major (1). `%rowcol`

must be a constant value.

The returned sequence of values represent the fragment held by the calling thread. How the elements of a matrix are distributed among the fragments is opaque to the user and is different for matrix `A`

, `B`

and the accumulator. Therefore, three variants (i.e. `ld.a`

, `ld.b`

, and `ld.c`

) are provided.

These intrinsics are overloaded based on the address spaces. The address space number `<n>`

must be either 0 (generic), 1 (global) or 3 (shared).

The behavior of this intrinsic is undefined if any thread in the warp has exited.

####
15.6.5.2. Store Fragments[](https://docs.nvidia.com#store-fragments)

The following intrinsics synchronize all threads in a warp and then store a fragment of a matrix for each thread.

```
; The last 8 arguments are the elements of the C fragment
declare void @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m16n16k16.st.c.f32.p<n>float(float addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol, float, float, float, float, float, float, float, float);

; The last 4 arguments are the elements of the C fragment
declare void @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m16n16k16.st.c.f16.p<n>i32(i32 addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol, i32, i32, i32, i32);
declare void @llvm.nvvm.hmma.m32n8k16.st.c.f16.p<n>i32(i32 addrspace(<n>)* %ptr, i32 %ldm, i32 %rowcol, i32, i32, i32, i32);

```

These intrinsics store an accumulator fragment to memory at location `%ptr`

. The matrix in memory must be in a canonical matrix layout with leading dimension `%ldm`

. `%rowcol`

specifies which the matrix in memory is row-major (0) or column-major (1). `%rowcol`

must be a constant value.

These intrinsics are overloaded based on the address spaces. The address space number `<n>`

must be either 0 (generic), 1 (global) or 3 (shared).

The behavior of this intrinsic is undefined if any thread in the warp has exited.

These intrinsics perform a matrix multiply-and-accumulate operation. `%rowcol`

specifies the layout of `A`

and `B`

fragments. It must be a constant value, which can have the following values and semantics.

Encoding |
Meaning |
|---|---|
0 |
A fragment is row-major, B fragment is row-major |
1 |
A fragment is row-major, B fragment is column-major |
2 |
A fragment is column-major, B fragment is row-major |
3 |
A fragment is column-major, B fragment is column-major |

Support for `%satf`

has been removed and this operand must be a constant zero.

The behavior of these intrinsics are undefined if any thread in the warp has exited.

To enable source level debugging of an IR module, NVVM IR supports debug intrinsics and debug information descriptors to express the debugging information. Debug information descriptors are represented using specialized metadata nodes. The current NVVM IR debug metadata version is 3.1.

NVVM IR debugging support is based on that in LLVM 7.0.1 for pre-Blackwell
targets and LLVM 22.1.0 for Blackwell and later targets. For the complete
semantics of the IR, readers of this chapter should refer to the official LLVM
IR [Specialized Metadata Nodes](https://releases.llvm.org/7.0.1/docs/LangRef.html#specialized-metadata-nodes)
and the [Source Level Debugging](https://releases.llvm.org/7.0.1/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.html) documents.
Blackwell and later targets should refer to [this](https://releases.llvm.org/22.1.0/docs/LangRef.html#specialized-metadata-nodes) and [this](https://releases.llvm.org/22.1.0/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.html) document
respectively.

The following metadata nodes need to be present in the module when debugging support is requested:

Named metadata node

`!llvm.dbg.cu`

Module flags metadata for

`"Debug Info Version"`

flag: The*behavior*flag should be`Error`

. The value of the flag should be`DEBUG_METADATA_VERSION`

, which is 3.Named metadata

`!nvvmir.version`

containing a metadata node with the NVVM IR major and minor version values followed by the NVVM IR debug metadata major and minor version values. The current NVVM IR debug metadata version is 3.1.-
The debug resolution (e.g., full, line info only) is controlled by the DICompileUnit’s

`emissionKind`

field:`FullDebug (value: 1)`

: Generate symbolic debug and line information. This requires the libNVVM`-g`

option to be specified at compile time.`DebugDirectivesOnly (value: 3)`

: Generate line information.


Source level debugging is supported only for a single debug compile unit. If there are multiple input NVVM IR modules, at most one module may have a single debug compile unit.

**Version 1.0**

Initial Release.


**Version 1.1**

Added support for UVM managed variables in global property annotation. See

[Supported Properties](https://docs.nvidia.com/index.html#supported-properties).

**Version 1.2**

Update to LLVM 3.4 for CUDA 7.0.

Remove address space intrinsics in favor of

`addrspacecast`

.Add information about source level debugging support.


**Version 1.3**

Add support for LLVM 3.8 for CUDA 8.0.


**Version 1.4**

Add support for warp-level intrinsics.


**Version 1.5**

Add support for LLVM 5.0 for CUDA 9.2.


**Version 1.6**

Update to LLVM 7.0.1 for CUDA 11.2.


**Version 1.7**

Add support for alloca with dynamic size.


**Version 1.8**

Add support for i128 in data layout.


**Version 1.9**

Modified text about ignoring shared variable initializations.


**Version 1.10**

Added support for grid_constant kernel parameters for CUDA 11.7.


**Version 1.11**

Added support for Hopper+ cluster intrinsics and max_blocks_per_cluster kernel property for CUDA 11.8.

Deprecated support for 32-bit compilation.


**Version 2.0**

Updated the NVVM IR to version 2.0 which is incompatible with NVVM IR version 1.x

Removed address space conversion intrinsics. The IR verifier on 2.0 IR will give an error when these intrinsics are present. Clients of libNVVM are advised to use addrspacecast instruction instead.

Stricter error checking on the supported datalayouts.

Older style loop unroll pragma metadata on loop backedges is no longer supported. Clients are advised to use the newer loop pragma metadata defined by the LLVM framework.

Shared variable initialization with non-undef values is no longer supported. In 1.x versions these initializers were ignored silently. This feature makes the 2.0 version incompatible with 1.x versions.
