# Tokenizer

The Dynamo Frontend supports multiple tokenizer backends for BPE-based `tokenizer.json`

models. `BPE`

is the underlying tokenization algorithm, not a backend-specific feature: both the default HuggingFace path and the `fastokens`

path can serve these models. The backend choice controls which implementation performs tokenization before requests are sent to the inference engine.

## Tokenizer Backends

`default`

HuggingFace Tokenizers

The default backend uses the [HuggingFace tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library (Rust).
It supports features in

`tokenizer.json`

files (normalizers, pre-tokenizers, post-processors, decoders, added tokens with special-token flags, and byte-fallback).`fastokens`

High-Performance Encoder

The `fastokens`

backend uses the [ fastokens](https://github.com/Atero-ai/fastokens) crate, a purpose-built encoder optimized for throughput on supported BPE

`tokenizer.json`

models.
It is a *hybrid*backend: encoding uses

`fastokens`

while decoding falls back to HuggingFace so that incremental detokenization, byte-fallback, and special-token handling work correctly.Use this backend when tokenization is a measurable bottleneck, for example on high-concurrency prefill-heavy workloads.

#### Compatibility notes:

- Works with standard BPE
`tokenizer.json`

files (Qwen, LLaMA, GPT-family, Mistral, DeepSeek, etc.). - If
`fastokens`

cannot load a particular tokenizer file, the frontend logs a warning and transparently falls back to HuggingFace; requests are never dropped. - Has no effect on TikToken-format tokenizers (
`.model`

/`.tiktoken`

files), which always use the TikToken backend.

## Configuration

Set the backend with a CLI flag or environment variable. The CLI flag takes precedence.

**Examples:**

## Dynamo Frontend Behavior

When `DYN_TOKENIZER=fastokens`

is set:

- The frontend passes the environment variable to the Rust runtime.
- When building the tokenizer for a model,
`ModelDeploymentCard::tokenizer()`

attempts to load`fastokens::Tokenizer`

from the same`tokenizer.json`

file. - If loading succeeds, a hybrid
`FastTokenizer`

is created that encodes with`fastokens`

and decodes with HuggingFace. - If loading fails (unsupported tokenizer features, missing file, etc.), the frontend logs a warning and falls back to the standard HuggingFace backend; no operator intervention is needed.
