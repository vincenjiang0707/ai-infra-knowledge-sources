# Reference Guide

## Overview

The vLLM backend in Dynamo integrates [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) engines into Dynamo’s distributed runtime, enabling disaggregated serving, KV-aware routing, and request cancellation. Dynamo leverages vLLM’s native KV cache events, NIXL-based transfer mechanisms, and metric reporting.

Dynamo vLLM uses vLLM’s native argument parser — all vLLM engine arguments are passed through directly. Dynamo adds its own arguments for disaggregation mode, KV transfer, and prompt embeddings.

## Argument Reference

The vLLM backend accepts all upstream vLLM engine arguments plus Dynamo-specific arguments. The authoritative source is always the CLI:

The `--help`

output is organized into the following groups:

**Dynamo Runtime Options**— Namespace, discovery backend, request/event plane, endpoint types, tool/reasoning parsers, and custom chat templates. These are common across all Dynamo backends and use`DYN_*`

env vars.**Dynamo vLLM Options**— Disaggregation mode, tokenizer selection, sleep mode, multimodal flags, vLLM-Omni pipeline configuration, headless mode, and ModelExpress. These use`DYN_VLLM_*`

env vars.**vLLM Engine Options**— All native vLLM arguments (`--model`

,`--tensor-parallel-size`

,`--kv-transfer-config`

,`--kv-events-config`

,`--enable-prefix-caching`

, etc.). See the[vLLM serve args documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/configuration/serve_args.html).

### Tool and Reasoning Parsers

Use `--dyn-tool-call-parser`

and `--dyn-reasoning-parser`

to match the model’s output format when the model emits tool calls and/or reasoning content. The current supported values are documented in [Tool Call Parsing (Dynamo)](https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/v1.2.1/user-guides/parsing/tool-call-parsing-dynamo#supported-tool-call-parsers) and [Reasoning Parsing (Dynamo)](https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/v1.2.1/user-guides/parsing/reasoning-parsing-dynamo#supported-reasoning-parsers).

### Priority Scheduling

vLLM engine-level request priority is controlled by the upstream vLLM
`--scheduling-policy priority`

argument.

Clients still send the Dynamo API value directly:
`nvext.agent_hints.priority`

. Higher values mean higher priority at the Dynamo
API layer. Dynamo converts that value before passing it to vLLM, which uses a
different native priority polarity internally.

Do not negate `nvext.agent_hints.priority`

in the client for vLLM. If you are
also using the router queue, configure the frontend-side
`--router-queue-threshold`

separately; vLLM engine scheduling only applies
after a request reaches the worker.

For the cross-layer behavior, see
[Priority Scheduling](https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/v1.2.1/user-guides/agents/priority-scheduling). For the upstream
flag definition, see the
[vLLM serve args documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/configuration/serve_args.html).

### Prompt Embeddings

Dynamo supports [vLLM prompt embeddings](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/features/prompt_embeds.html) — pre-computed embeddings bypass tokenization in the Rust frontend and are decoded to tensors in the worker.

- Enable with
`--enable-prompt-embeds`

(disabled by default) - Embeddings are sent as base64-encoded PyTorch tensors via the
`prompt_embeds`

field in the Completions API - NATS must be configured with a 15MB max payload for large embeddings (already set in default deployments)

## Hashing Consistency for KV Events

When using KV-aware routing, ensure deterministic hashing across processes to avoid radix tree mismatches. Choose one of the following:

- Set
`PYTHONHASHSEED=0`

for all vLLM processes when relying on Python’s built-in hashing for prefix caching. - If your vLLM version supports it, configure a deterministic prefix caching algorithm:

See the high-level notes in [Router Design](https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/v1.2.1/design-docs/component-design/router-design#deterministic-event-ids) on deterministic event IDs.

## Graceful Shutdown

vLLM workers use Dynamo’s graceful shutdown mechanism. When a `SIGTERM`

or `SIGINT`

is received:

**Discovery unregister**: The worker is removed from service discovery so no new requests are routed to it**Grace period**: In-flight requests are allowed to complete (configurable via`DYN_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_PERIOD_SECS`

, default 5s)**Resource cleanup**: Engine resources and temporary files (Prometheus dirs, LoRA adapters) are released

All vLLM endpoints use `graceful_shutdown=True`

, meaning they wait for in-flight requests to finish before exiting. An internal `VllmEngineMonitor`

also checks engine health every 2 seconds and initiates shutdown if the engine becomes unresponsive.

For more details, see [Graceful Shutdown](https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/v1.2.1/user-guides/fault-tolerance/graceful-shutdown).

## Health Checks

Each worker type has a specialized health check payload that validates the full inference pipeline:

Health checks are registered with the Dynamo runtime and called by the frontend or Kubernetes liveness probes. The payload can be overridden via `DYN_HEALTH_CHECK_PAYLOAD`

environment variable. See [Health Checks](https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/v1.2.1/user-guides/observability-local/health-checks) for the broader health check architecture.

## Request Cancellation

When a user cancels a request (e.g., by disconnecting from the frontend), the request is automatically cancelled across all workers, freeing compute resources.

For more details, see the [Request Cancellation Architecture](https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/v1.2.1/user-guides/fault-tolerance/request-cancellation) documentation.

## Request Migration

Dynamo supports [request migration](https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/v1.2.1/user-guides/fault-tolerance/request-migration) to handle worker failures gracefully. When enabled, requests can be automatically migrated to healthy workers if a worker fails mid-generation. See the [Request Migration Architecture](https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/v1.2.1/user-guides/fault-tolerance/request-migration) documentation for configuration details.
