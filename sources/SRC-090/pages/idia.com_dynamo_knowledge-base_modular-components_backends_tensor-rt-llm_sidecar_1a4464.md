TensorRT-LLM Sidecar


TensorRT-LLM Sidecar

Run Dynamo beside a stock TensorRT-LLM engine through native gRPC.

**Experimental.** The TensorRT-LLM sidecar, launcher, packaging, and feature
coverage can change without notice.

`dynamo-trtllm-sidecar`

is a CPU-only Dynamo worker that connects to
TensorRT-LLM’s native gRPC service. It preserves the upstream engine process
and argument surface while using Dynamo for request handling and distributed
serving. See the
[Sidecar Backends](https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/knowledge-base/concepts/system-architecture/sidecar-backends-experimental) page for the common
architecture.

## Readiness

This table covers launch topology only. The
[TensorRT-LLM feature matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/dynamo/knowledge-base/modular-components/backends/tensor-rt-llm/overview#feature-support-matrix) describes the
in-process backend; sidecar feature parity is still under evaluation. The
current native gRPC contract does not provide the prefill/decode handoff needed
for disaggregated serving. See the
[TensorRT-LLM sidecar README](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/v1.4.2/lib/sidecar/trtllm/README.md)
for other protocol limitations.

## Launch Locally

From a Dynamo source checkout, build or install Dynamo so
`dynamo-trtllm-sidecar`

is on `PATH`

. Install a TensorRT-LLM release that
provides `tensorrt_llm.commands.serve --grpc`

.

Start Dynamo’s local discovery services, then run the aggregated launcher:

The launcher starts the Dynamo frontend, TensorRT-LLM engine, and sidecar. It binds TensorRT-LLM’s native gRPC endpoint to loopback.

Verify the frontend:

## Deploy on Kubernetes

No published TensorRT-LLM sidecar image is available yet. Follow the
[Kubernetes quick start](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/v1.4.2/lib/sidecar/trtllm/README.md#deploy-on-kubernetes-quick-start)
to build the CPU-only sidecar image and pair it with a stock upstream
TensorRT-LLM image. The source tree includes an
[aggregated deployment manifest](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/v1.4.2/lib/sidecar/trtllm/deploy/agg.yaml).
