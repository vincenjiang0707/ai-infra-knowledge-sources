Nemotron-3-Ultra


Nemotron-3-Ultra

Serve Nemotron-3-Ultra with optimized Dynamo 1.4.0 and vLLM profiles on B200, GB200, and H200.

The Nemotron-3-Ultra recipe serves
`nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Ultra-550B-A55B-NVFP4`

with optimized aggregated and
disaggregated Dynamo profiles. The model’s native context length is 256K. The 1M profiles are an
explicit long-context enablement that overrides the serving framework’s model-length guardrail;
they do not change the model’s native context length in `config.json`

. The qualified 1M settings
are carried in separate manifests.

All profiles use the released public `vllm-runtime:1.4.0`

image pinned by digest. No NGC image pull
secret is required.

## Profiles

The aggregated profiles run two workers behind KV-aware routing. Aggregated 256K profiles use five-token MTP; aggregated 1M profiles run without speculative decoding. Disaggregated profiles split prefill and decode, use NIXL/UCX over the qualified RDMA path, and run without MTP.

All profiles enable prefix caching, asynchronous scheduling, FP8 KV cache, BF16 Mamba state, and hybrid KV cache management with Expert Parallelism disabled.

The B200 and GB200 256K disaggregated profiles use FlashInfer attention; the H200 256K profile uses
FlashAttention. B200 and H200 use UCX/RDMA with `rdma/ib`

resources. GB200 uses GKE multi-network
MRDMA and its four qualified RDMA interfaces.

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster with the Dynamo Platform installed and the DGD CRDs available.
- Enough GPUs for the selected profile: 8 B200/GB200 or 16 H200 for aggregated profiles; 12 B200/GB200 or 24 H200 for 256K disaggregated profiles; 8 B200/GB200 or 16 H200 for 1M disaggregated profiles.
- A
`shared-model-cache`

PVC containing the Ultra model view, or permission to create the approximately 1200 GiB PVC and populate it. - A Hugging Face token with access to the checkpoint when populating the model cache.

Create the namespace and Hugging Face secret when the model must be downloaded:

Review the namespace, storage class, node selectors, tolerations, and cluster-specific RDMA placement before applying a manifest.

## Prepare the model cache

Create and populate the model cache, then validate the model view before deployment:

The runtime image and model weights are decoupled. The download Job writes the checkpoint to the PVC; the deployment pods mount that validated model view.

## Deploy

Deploy an aggregated profile:

Deploy the selected disaggregated profile. The qualified 256K topology is 1P2D; the qualified 1M topology is 1P1D:

Monitor the resulting deployment:

## Smoke test

Forward the selected deployment’s frontend service. For example:

Verify model discovery and chat completions:

## Benchmark

All profiles share one AIPerf Job and runner. Edit the Job environment for the selected DGD, frontend endpoint, context, reference concurrency, GPU count, and worker count before applying it:

The runner uses AIPerf 0.12.0 and the complete 15% agentic Moontrace replay with streaming chat,
server token counts, seed 42, and `ignore_eos:true`

. Benchmark artifacts are written to the
`shared-model-cache`

PVC.

See the [benchmark asset guide](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/recipes/nemotron-3-ultra/perf/README.md)
for the source files. Performance and release-review evidence are maintained outside the recipe
source tree.

## Known limitations

- Reasoning is controlled per request with
`chat_template_kwargs`

(`enable_thinking`

and`force_nonempty_content`

) and`nvext.max_thinking_tokens`

. Do not send`force_nonempty_content`

as a top-level request parameter. - With the OSS vLLM version bundled in Dynamo 1.4.0, reasoning-enabled requests using
`response_format`

with`json_object`

or`json_schema`

may return malformed JSON with HTTP 200. The fix is available upstream in[vLLM PR #44993](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/44993)but is not included in the pinned runtime. Disable thinking for constrained output when appropriate and validate structured output before consuming the response. - The same bundled OSS vLLM limitation affects reasoning-enabled requests using
`tool_choice: "required"`

or a named tool choice: the response may contain plain`content`

with`finish_reason: "stop"`

instead of structured`tool_calls`

. Disable thinking for constrained tool calls when appropriate and validate`tool_calls`

before consuming the response. - Raw Moontrace replay includes over-context and pathological long-generation rows. Preserve them as HTTP/error evidence rather than dropping them silently.
- Tool calling uses the
`qwen3_coder`

parser. Reasoning parsing uses the model-local`ultra_v3_reasoning_parser.py`

, which the model-validation Job checks before deployment.
