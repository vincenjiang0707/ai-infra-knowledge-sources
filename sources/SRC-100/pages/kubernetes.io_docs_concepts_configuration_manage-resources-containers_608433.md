When you specify a [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/), you can optionally specify how much of each resource a
[container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/) needs. The most common resources to specify are CPU and memory
(RAM); there are others.

When you specify the resource *request* for containers in a Pod, the
[kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/) uses this information to decide which node to place the Pod on.
When you specify a resource *limit* for a container, the [kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet) enforces those
limits so that the running container is not allowed to use more of that resource
than the limit you set. The kubelet also reserves at least the *request* amount of
that system resource specifically for that container to use.

If the node where a Pod is running has enough of a resource available, it's possible (and
allowed) for a container to use more resource than its `request`

for that resource specifies.

For example, if you set a `memory`

request of 256 MiB for a container, and that container is in
a Pod scheduled to a Node with 8GiB of memory and no other Pods, then the container can try to use
more RAM.

Limits are a different story. Both `cpu`

and `memory`

limits are applied by the kubelet (and
[container runtime](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes)),
and are ultimately enforced by the kernel. On Linux nodes, the Linux kernel
enforces limits with
[cgroups](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-cgroup).
The behavior of `cpu`

and `memory`

limit enforcement is slightly different.

`cpu`

limits are enforced by CPU throttling. When a container approaches
its `cpu`

limit, the kernel will restrict access to the CPU corresponding to the
container's limit. Thus, a `cpu`

limit is a hard limit the kernel enforces.
Containers may not use more CPU than is specified in their `cpu`

limit.

`memory`

limits are enforced by the kernel with out of memory (OOM) kills. When
a container uses more than its `memory`

limit, the kernel may terminate it. However,
terminations only happen when the kernel detects memory pressure. Thus, a
container that over allocates memory may not be immediately killed. This means
`memory`

limits are enforced reactively. A container may use more memory than
its `memory`

limit, but if it does, it may get killed.

`MemoryQoS`

which adds memory throttling and optional
tiered memory reservation on Linux nodes using cgroup v2. For details, see
A *resource type* has a base unit and can be requested, limited, or both.
Kubernetes has the following built-in resource types:

| Resource type | Description | Base unit |
|---|---|---|
`cpu` | Compute processing | cpu (core) |
`memory` | RAM | Bytes |
`ephemeral-storage` |
|

`hugepages-<size>`

Clusters can also provide
[extended resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#extended-resources)
(resources with a custom name, typically exposed by device plugins).

For Linux workloads, you can specify *huge page* resources.
Huge pages are a Linux-specific feature where the node kernel allocates blocks of memory
that are much larger than the default page size.

For example, on a system where the default page size is 4KiB, you could specify a limit,
`hugepages-2Mi: 80Mi`

. If the container tries allocating over 40 2MiB huge pages (a
total of 80 MiB), that allocation fails.

`hugepages-*`

resources.
This is different from the `memory`

and `cpu`

resources.CPU and memory are collectively referred to as *compute resources*, or *resources*. Compute
resources are measurable quantities that can be requested, allocated, and
consumed. They are distinct from
[API resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/). API resources, such as Pods and
[Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) are objects that can be read and modified
through the Kubernetes API server.

For each container, you can specify resource limits and requests, including the following:

`spec.containers[].resources.limits.cpu`

`spec.containers[].resources.limits.memory`

`spec.containers[].resources.limits.ephemeral-storage`

`spec.containers[].resources.limits.hugepages-<size>`

`spec.containers[].resources.requests.cpu`

`spec.containers[].resources.requests.memory`

`spec.containers[].resources.requests.ephemeral-storage`

`spec.containers[].resources.requests.hugepages-<size>`

Although you can only specify requests and limits for individual containers,
it is also useful to think about the overall resource requests and limits for
a Pod.
For a particular resource, a *Pod resource request/limit* is the sum of the
resource requests/limits of that type for each container in the Pod.

Provided your cluster has the `PodLevelResources`

[feature gate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) enabled,
you can specify resource requests and limits at
the Pod level. At the Pod level, Kubernetes 1.37
only supports resource requests or limits for specific resource types: `cpu`

and /
or `memory`

and / or `hugepages`

. With this feature, Kubernetes allows you to declare an overall resource
budget for the Pod, which is especially helpful when dealing with a large number of
containers where it can be difficult to accurately gauge individual resource needs.
Additionally, it enables containers within a Pod to share idle resources with each
other, improving resource utilization.

For a Pod, you can specify resource limits and requests for CPU and memory by including the following:

`spec.resources.limits.cpu`

`spec.resources.limits.memory`

`spec.resources.limits.hugepages-<size>`

`spec.resources.requests.cpu`

`spec.resources.requests.memory`

`spec.resources.requests.hugepages-<size>`

Limits and requests for CPU resources are measured in *cpu* units.
In Kubernetes, 1 CPU unit is equivalent to **1 physical CPU core**,
or **1 virtual core**, depending on whether the node is a physical host
or a virtual machine running inside a physical machine.

Fractional requests are allowed. When you define a container with
`spec.containers[].resources.requests.cpu`

set to `0.5`

, you are requesting half
as much CPU time compared to if you asked for `1.0`

CPU.
For CPU resource units, the [quantity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/quantity/) expression `0.1`

is equivalent to the
expression `100m`

, which can be read as "one hundred millicpu". Some people say
"one hundred millicores", and this is understood to mean the same thing.

CPU resource is always specified as an absolute amount of resource, never as a relative amount. For example,
`500m`

CPU represents the roughly same amount of computing power whether that container
runs on a single-core, dual-core, or 48-core machine.

Kubernetes doesn't allow you to specify CPU resources with a precision finer than
`1m`

or `0.001`

CPU. To avoid accidentally using an invalid CPU quantity, it's useful to specify CPU units using the milliCPU form
instead of the decimal form when using less than 1 CPU unit.

For example, you have a Pod that uses `5m`

or `0.005`

CPU and would like to decrease
its CPU resources. By using the decimal form, it's harder to spot that `0.0005`

CPU
is an invalid value, while by using the milliCPU form, it's easier to spot that
`0.5m`

is an invalid value.

Limits and requests for `memory`

are measured in bytes. You can express memory as
a plain integer or as a fixed-point number using one of these
[quantity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/quantity/) suffixes:
E, P, T, G, M, k. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents: Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi,
Mi, Ki. The Kubernetes API also allows m as a suffix (for millibytes: 1/1000 of a byte),
but this isn't useful to specify: you must always assign whole numbers of bytes, or sometimes larger chunks such as multiples of 1 gibibyte.

Here are some examples of memory quantities that represent roughly the same value:

```
128974848, 129e6, 129M, 128974848000m, 123Mi
```


Pay attention to the case of the suffixes. "M" means megabytes, while "m" means millibytes. If you request `400m`

of memory, this is a request for 0.4 bytes. Someone who types that probably meant to ask for 400 mebibytes (`400Mi`

)
or 400 megabytes (`400M`

).

The following Pod has two containers. Both containers are defined with a request for
0.25 CPU
and 64MiB (226 bytes) of memory. Each container has a limit of 0.5
CPU and 128MiB of memory. You can say the Pod has a request of 0.5 CPU and 128
MiB of memory, and a limit of 1 CPU and 256MiB of memory.

This feature can be enabled by setting the `PodLevelResources`

The following Pod has an explicit request of 1 CPU and 100 MiB of memory, and an
explicit limit of 1 CPU and 200 MiB of memory. The `pod-resources-demo-ctr-1`

container has explicit requests and limits set. However, the
`pod-resources-demo-ctr-2`

container will simply share the resources available
within the Pod resource boundaries, as it does not have explicit requests and limits
set.

When you create a Pod, the Kubernetes scheduler selects a node for the Pod to run on. Each node has a maximum capacity for each of the resource types: the amount of CPU and memory it can provide for Pods. The scheduler ensures that, for each resource type, the sum of the resource requests of the scheduled containers is less than the capacity of the node. Note that although actual memory or CPU resource usage on nodes is very low, the scheduler still refuses to place a Pod on a node if the capacity check fails. This protects against a resource shortage on a node when resource usage later increases, for example, during a daily peak in request rate.

When the kubelet starts a container as part of a Pod, the kubelet passes that container's requests and limits for memory and CPU to the container runtime.

On Linux, the container runtime typically configures
kernel [cgroups](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-cgroup) that apply and enforce the
limits you defined.

`memory.min`

and `memory.low`

.`emptyDir`

. The kubelet tracks `tmpfs`

emptyDir volumes as container
memory use, rather than as local `emptyDir`

,
be sure to check the notes If a container exceeds its memory request and the node that it runs on becomes short of
memory overall, it is likely that the Pod the container belongs to will be
[evicted](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/).

A container might or might not be allowed to exceed its CPU limit for extended periods of time. However, container runtimes don't terminate Pods or containers for excessive CPU usage.

To determine whether a container cannot be scheduled or is being killed due to resource limits,
see the [Troubleshooting](https://kubernetes.io#troubleshooting) section.

After creating a Pod, you may need to adjust its CPU or memory resources based on actual usage patterns. Kubernetes provides two approaches for resizing Pod resources:

This is a stable feature in Kubernetes, and has been since version v1.35. It was first available in the v1.27 release. You can no longer disable or opt out of this feature or behavior (it is locked); if you explicitly set a value for the associated feature gate `InPlacePodVerticalScaling`, Kubernetes ignores it but does not report any error.

You can modify the CPU and memory `requests`

and `limits`

of containers
in a running Pod without recreating it. This is called *in-place Pod vertical scaling*
or *in-place Pod resize*. To perform an in-place resize, update the container's resource
specifications using the Pod's `/resize`

subresource. You can control whether a container
restart is required by setting the `resizePolicy`

field in the container specification.

When the `InPlacePodVerticalScalingSchedulerPreemption`

feature gate is enabled,
deferred in-place resize requests can trigger `kube-scheduler`

to preempt
lower-priority Pods on the assigned node to make room for the resize.
For more details, see
[Preemption for in-place Pod resize](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/#preemption-for-in-place-pod-resize).

The cloud native approach to changing a Pod's resources is to update the Pod template in the workload object (such as a Deployment or StatefulSet) and let the workload's controller replace Pods with new ones that have the updated resources. This approach works with any Kubernetes version and can change any Pod specification.

For more details about Pod resizing, see [Resizing Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-resize).
For detailed instructions on in-place resize, see
[Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/).
You can also use the [Vertical Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/vertical-pod-autoscale/)
to automatically manage Pod resource recommendations.

The kubelet reports the resource usage of a Pod as part of the Pod
[ status](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/#object-spec-and-status).

If optional [tools for monitoring](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/resource-usage-monitoring/)
are available in your cluster, then Pod resource usage can be retrieved either
from the [Metrics API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/resource-metrics-pipeline/#metrics-api)
directly or from your monitoring tools.

When the `InPlacePodVerticalScalingMemoryBackedVolumes`

feature gate is enabled, you can dynamically adjust the `sizeLimit`

of a memory-backed (`medium: Memory`

) `emptyDir`

volume on a running Pod without requiring Pod recreation or container restarts. For step-by-step instructions, see [Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/#resizing-memory-backed-emptydir-volumes).

`sizeLimit`

for an `emptyDir`

volume, that volume may
consume up to that pod's memory limit (`Pod.spec.containers[].resources.limits.memory`

).
If you do not set a memory limit, the pod has no upper bound on memory consumption,
and can consume all available memory on the node. Kubernetes schedules pods based
on resource requests (`Pod.spec.containers[].resources.requests`

) and will not
consider memory usage above the request when deciding if another pod can fit on
a given node. This can result in a denial of service and cause the OS to do
out-of-memory (OOM) handling. It is possible to create any number of `emptyDir`

s
that could potentially consume all available memory on the node, making OOM
more likely.From the perspective of memory management, there are some similarities between
when a process uses memory as a work area and when using memory-backed
`emptyDir`

. But when using memory as a volume, like memory-backed `emptyDir`

,
there are additional points below that you should be careful of:

`emptyDir`

is useful because of its performance, but memory
is generally much smaller in size and much higher in cost than other storage
media, such as disks or SSDs. Using large amounts of memory for `emptyDir`

volumes may affect the normal operation of your pod or of the whole node,
so should be used carefully.If you are administering a cluster or namespace, you can also set
[ResourceQuota](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/) that limits memory use;
you may also want to define a [LimitRange](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/)
for additional enforcement.
If you specify a `spec.containers[].resources.limits.memory`

for each Pod,
then the maximum size of an `emptyDir`

volume will be the pod's memory limit.

As an alternative, a cluster administrator can enforce size limits for
`emptyDir`

volumes in new Pods using a policy mechanism such as
[ValidatingAdmissionPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/).

For general concepts about local ephemeral storage and hints about
configuring the requests and/or limits of ephemeral storage for a container,
please check the [local ephemeral storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/ephemeral-storage/)
page.

The kubelet can measure how much local ephemeral storage is being used. It does this as long as you have enabled local ephemeral storage capacity isolation.

Kubernetes tracks the amount of ephemeral storage a Pod uses from the following:

`emptyDir`

volumes.`/var/log/pods`

).`/etc/hosts`

.Extended resources are fully-qualified resource names outside the
`kubernetes.io`

domain. They allow cluster operators to advertise and users to
consume the non-Kubernetes-built-in resources.

There are two steps required to use Extended Resources. First, the cluster operator must advertise an Extended Resource. Second, users must request the Extended Resource in Pods.

Node-level extended resources are tied to nodes.

See [Device
Plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/device-plugins/)
for how to advertise device plugin managed resources on each node.

To advertise a new node-level extended resource, the cluster operator can
submit a `PATCH`

HTTP request to the API server to specify the available
quantity in the `status.capacity`

for a node in the cluster. After this
operation, the node's `status.capacity`

will include a new resource. The
`status.allocatable`

field is updated automatically with the new resource
asynchronously by the kubelet.

Because the scheduler uses the node's `status.allocatable`

value when
evaluating Pod fitness, the scheduler only takes account of the new value after
that asynchronous update. There may be a short delay between patching the
node capacity with a new resource and the time when the first Pod that requests
the resource can be scheduled on that node.

**Example:**

Here is an example showing how to use `curl`

to form an HTTP request that
advertises five "example.com/foo" resources on node `k8s-node-1`

whose master
is `k8s-master`

.

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json-patch+json" \
--request PATCH \
--data '[{"op": "add", "path": "/status/capacity/example.com~1foo", "value": "5"}]' \
http://k8s-master:8080/api/v1/nodes/k8s-node-1/status
```


`~1`

is the encoding for the character `/`

in the patch path. The operation path value in JSON-Patch is interpreted as a
JSON-Pointer. For more details, see
Cluster-level extended resources are not tied to nodes. They are usually managed by scheduler extenders, which handle the resource consumption and resource quota.

You can specify the extended resources that are handled by scheduler extenders
in [scheduler configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kube-scheduler-config.v1/)

**Example:**

The following configuration for a scheduler policy indicates that the cluster-level extended resource "example.com/foo" is handled by the scheduler extender.

`ignoredByScheduler`

field specifies that the scheduler does not check
the "example.com/foo" resource in its `PodFitsResources`

predicate.```

"kind": "Policy",
"apiVersion": "v1",
"extenders": [
{
"urlPrefix":"<extender-endpoint>",

```


Extended resources allocation by DRA allows cluster administrators to specify an `extendedResourceName`

in DeviceClass, then the devices matching the DeviceClass can be requested from a pod's extended
resource requests. Read more about
[Extended Resource allocation by DRA](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/resource-management/dynamic-resource-allocation/dra-features/#extended-resource).

Users can consume extended resources in Pod specs like CPU and memory. The scheduler takes care of the resource accounting so that no more than the available amount is simultaneously allocated to Pods.

The API server restricts quantities of extended resources to whole numbers.
Examples of *valid* quantities are `3`

, `3000m`

and `3Ki`

. Examples of
*invalid* quantities are `0.5`

and `1500m`

(because `1500m`

would result in `1.5`

).

`kubernetes.io`

which is reserved.To consume an extended resource in a Pod, include the resource name as a key
in the `spec.containers[].resources.limits`

map in the container spec.

A Pod is scheduled only if all of the resource requests are satisfied, including
CPU, memory and any extended resources. The Pod remains in the `PENDING`

state
as long as the resource request cannot be satisfied.

**Example:**

The Pod below requests 2 CPUs and 1 "example.com/foo" (an extended resource).

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: my-pod
spec:
containers:
- name: my-container
image: myimage
resources:
requests:
cpu: 2
example.com/foo: 1
limits:
example.com/foo: 1
```


Process ID (PID) limits allow for the configuration of a kubelet
to limit the number of PIDs that a given Pod can consume. See
[PID Limiting](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pid-limiting/) for information.

`FailedScheduling`

If the scheduler cannot find any node where a Pod can fit, the Pod remains
unscheduled until a place can be found. An
[Event](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/) is produced
each time the scheduler fails to find a place for the Pod. You can use `kubectl`

to view the events for a Pod; for example:

```
kubectl describe pod frontend | grep -A 9999999999 Events
```


```
Events:
Type Reason Age From Message
---- ------ ---- ---- -------
Warning FailedScheduling 23s default-scheduler 0/42 nodes available: insufficient cpu
```


In the preceding example, the Pod named "frontend" fails to be scheduled due to insufficient CPU resource on any node. Similar error messages can also suggest failure due to insufficient memory (PodExceedsFreeMemory). In general, if a Pod is pending with a message of this type, there are several things to try:

`cpu: 1`

, then a Pod with a request of `cpu: 1.1`

will
never be scheduled.You can check node capacities and amounts allocated with the
`kubectl describe nodes`

command. For example:

```
kubectl describe nodes e2e-test-node-pool-4lw4
```


```
Name: e2e-test-node-pool-4lw4

```


In the preceding output, you can see that if a Pod requests more than 1.120 CPUs or more than 6.23Gi of memory, that Pod will not fit on the node.

By looking at the “Pods” section, you can see which Pods are taking up space on the node.

The amount of resources available to Pods is less than the node capacity because
system daemons use a portion of the available resources. Within the Kubernetes API,
each Node has a `.status.allocatable`

field
(see [NodeStatus](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/node-v1/#NodeStatus)
for details).

The `.status.allocatable`

field describes the amount of resources that are available
to Pods on that node (for example: 15 virtual CPUs and 7538 MiB of memory).
For more information on node allocatable resources in Kubernetes, see
[Reserve Compute Resources for System Daemons](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/).

You can configure [resource quotas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/)
to limit the total amount of resources that a namespace can consume.
Kubernetes enforces quotas for objects in particular namespace when there is a
ResourceQuota in that namespace.
For example, if you assign specific namespaces to different teams, you
can add ResourceQuotas into those namespaces. Setting resource quotas helps to
prevent one team from using so much of any resource that this over-use affects other teams.

You should also consider what access you grant to that namespace:
**full** write access to a namespace allows someone with that access to remove any
resource, including a configured ResourceQuota.

Your container might get terminated because it is resource-starved. To check
whether a container is being killed because it is hitting a resource limit, call
`kubectl describe pod`

on the Pod of interest:

```
kubectl describe pod simmemleak-hra99
```


The output is similar to:

```

In the preceding example, the `Restart Count: 5`

indicates that the `simmemleak`

container in the Pod was terminated and restarted five times (so far).
The `OOMKilled`

reason shows that the container tried to use more memory than its limit.

Your next step might be to check the application code for a memory leak. If you find that the application is behaving how you expect, consider setting a higher memory limit (and possibly request) for that container.
