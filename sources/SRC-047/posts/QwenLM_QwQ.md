## Introduction

QwQ is the reasoning-specialized model within the Qwen series. Unlike traditional instruction-tuned models, QwQ leverages advanced reasoning and critical thinking abilities to achieve superior performance on downstream tasks, especially those involving complex problem-solving. Our latest release, QwQ-32B, is a mid-sized model that competes effectively with top-tier reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and o1-mini, delivering robust and competitive results.

**Note:** Please review the [Usage Guidelines](#usage-guidelines) before deploying QwQ models, especially if you encounter **endless repetitions or significant performance issues**.

## Performance

To reproduce the results, please refer to [our evaluation code](./eval).


## Quickstart with HuggingFace's transformers

QwQ is based on Qwen2.5, which has been in the latest Huggingface `transformers`. We advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.

With `transformers<4.37.0`, you will encounter the following error:
```
KeyError: 'qwen2'
```

Here provides a code snippet with `apply_chat_template` to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
model_name = "Qwen/QwQ-32B"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
prompt = "How many r's are in the word \"strawberry\""
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=32768
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]
response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(response)
```

## Usage Guidelines

To achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:

1. **Enforce Thoughtful Output**: Ensure the model starts with "\<think\>\n" to prevent generating empty thinking content, which can degrade output quality. If you use `apply_chat_template` and set `add_generation_prompt=True`, this is already automatically implemented, but it may cause the response to lack the \<think\> tag at the beginning. This is normal behavior.

2. **Sampling Parameters**:
   - **We recommend using Temperature=0.6, TopP=0.95, MinP=0, TopK=40, and no repetition penalty for optimal performance.**
   - Do **NOT** use Greedy decoding under any circumstances! It will lead to endless repetitions.
   - You can adjust the TopK value between 20 and 40 to balance filtering out rare token occurrences and enhancing the diversity of the generated output.
   - For supported frameworks, you can adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in performance.

3. **No Thinking Content in History**: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. This feature is already implemented in `apply_chat_template`.

4. **Standardize Output Format**: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.
   - **Math Problems**: Include "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." in the prompt.
   - **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: "Please show your choice in the `answer` field with only the choice letter, e.g.,`\"answer\": \"C\"`." in the prompt.

5. **Handle Long Inputs**: For inputs exceeding 8,192 tokens, enable [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071) to improve the model's ability to capture long-sequence information effectively.

    For supported frameworks, you could add the following to `config.json` to enable YaRN:
    ```json
    {
        ...,
        "rope_scaling": {
            "factor": 4.0,
            "original_max_position_embeddings": 32768,
            "type": "yarn"
        }
    }
    ```
    For deployment, we recommend using vLLM. Please refer to our [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html) for usage if you are not familiar with vLLM.
    Presently, vLLM only supports static YARN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts**. 
    We advise adding the `rope_scaling` configuration only when processing long contexts is required.

## Ollama and Llama.cpp

To run the Qwen/QwQ-32B-GGUF model with Ollama, use the following command.

```bash
ollama run hf.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B-GGUF:Q4_K_M # select one from Q8_0; Q6_K; Q5_K_M; Q5_0; Q4_K_M; Q4_0; Q3_K_M; Q2_K.
# For modelscope User
ollama run modelscope.cn/Qwen/QwQ-32B-GGUF:Q4_K_M
```

If you're using Llama.cpp, you can run the model with the following command.  This example uses the ``Q4_K_M`` quantization:

```bash
./llama-cli \
    --model QwQ-32B-GGUF/qwq-32b-q4_k_m.gguf \
    --threads 32 \
    --ctx-size 32768 \
    --seed 1234 \
    --temp 0.6 \
    --min-p 0.0 \
    --top-k 40 \
    --top-p 0.95 \
    -no-cnv \
    --samplers "top_k;top_p;min_p;temperature;" \
    --prompt "<|im_start|>user\nHow many r's are in the word \"strawberry\"<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n"
```

You can also consult [Unsloth's Guide](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/tutorial-how-to-run-qwq-32b-effectively) to see if their approach meets your needs. (Thanks to the Unsloth team!)

## Try QwQ with API

If you face issues in deploying QwQ, we encourage you to test our API service provided by [Alibaba Cloud Model Studio](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/developer-reference/what-is-qwen-llm).


```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

# Initialize OpenAI client
client = OpenAI(
    # If the environment variable is not configured, replace with your API Key: api_key="sk-xxx"
    # How to get an API Key：https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/developer-reference/get-api-key
    api_key=os.getenv("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"),
    base_url="https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
)

reasoning_content = ""
content = ""

is_answering = False

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="qwq-32b",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Which is larger, 9.9 or 9.11?"}
    ],
    stream=True,
    # Uncomment the following line to return token usage in the last chunk
    # stream_options={
    #     "include_usage": True
    # }
)

print("\n" + "=" * 20 + "reasoning content" + "=" * 20 + "\n")

for chunk in completion:
    # If chunk.choices is empty, print usage
    if not chunk.choices:
        print("\nUsage:")
        print(chunk.usage)
    else:
        delta = chunk.choices[0].delta
        # Print reasoning content
        if hasattr(delta, 'reasoning_content') and delta.reasoning_content is not None:
            print(delta.reasoning_content, end='', flush=True)
            reasoning_content += delta.reasoning_content
        else:
            if delta.content != "" and is_answering is False:
                print("\n" + "=" * 20 + "content" + "=" * 20 + "\n")
                is_answering = True
            # Print content
            print(delta.content, end='', flush=True)
            content += delta.content
```
