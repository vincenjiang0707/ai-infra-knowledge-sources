## 💡 Introduction

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/fig_teaser.png" alt="Qwen-RobotNav Overview" width="90%"/>
</div>

<br>

**Qwen-RobotNav** is a scalable navigation model built on **Qwen3-VL**. It unifies instruction following, point-goal and object-goal navigation, target tracking, autonomous driving, and embodied question answering under a shared waypoint-prediction interface.

The key idea is to treat navigation as **context modeling**. Different navigation tasks share a perception-planning backbone, but they require different strategies for consuming visual history: long-horizon instruction following needs memory, target tracking needs recent high-resolution frames, object search shifts between exploration and local approach, and driving depends on multi-view short-term motion context.

Qwen-RobotNav exposes this difference as a configurable observation protocol. An upper-level planner can call the same model with different task modes and context parameters, making Qwen-RobotNav a natural navigation primitive for agentic systems.

### ✨ Key Highlights

- **🧭 Unified Multi-Domain Navigation.** One model covers VLN, PointNav/ObjectNav, target tracking, autonomous driving, and EQA.

- **⚙️ Controllable Observation Protocol.** Token budget, temporal decay, per-camera weights, and frame sampling mode are inference-time controls.

- **🧠 Agentic Navigation Interface.** The model can be called as a reconfigurable waypoint executor inside a two-tier planner with memory.

- **📈 Scalable Training.** Qwen-RobotNav is trained on **15.6M** samples with trajectory supervision and vision-language co-training, showing favorable scaling from 2B to 8B.

- **🌍 In-the-Wild Generalization.** The model demonstrates zero-shot transfer to real-world robots and unseen environments.


## 🧠 Method

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/qwenrobot/robotnav/fig_pipeline.png" alt="Qwen-RobotNav Pipeline" width="90%"/>
</div>

Qwen-RobotNav inherits the Qwen3-VL backbone and adds a lightweight **4-layer MLP action head**. It outputs **8 waypoints**, each parameterized as `(x, y, theta)`, so diverse navigation tasks can be expressed as trajectory prediction under different prompts and observation configurations.

The core interface is a task-adaptive observation protocol with four main control axes:

- **Visual token budget:** total visual tokens shared across cameras and timesteps.
- **Temporal decay:** how strongly recent frames are favored over older observations.
- **Camera weights:** per-camera importance, such as emphasizing the forward view.
- **Frame sampling mode:** random sampling for broad history coverage or latest-frame sampling for recency.

During training, these parameters are randomized per sample. This lets Qwen-RobotNav accept new inference-time configurations without modifying the Qwen3-VL backbone or retraining a task-specific model.

Temporal order and camera identity are represented with natural-language tags interleaved with visual tokens, such as `Time step 0` and `Front View <image>`. This reuses Qwen3-VL's language space rather than adding custom time or viewpoint embeddings.

  <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/qwenrobot/robotnav/fig_agents_overview.png" alt="Qwen-RobotNav Agentic System" width="90%"/>
</div>

In the agentic system, an upper-level planner decomposes long-horizon goals into sub-goals, chooses the task mode, and sets the observation configuration for each call. RobotNav executes each segment as a reactive waypoint predictor, while compact trajectory summaries and persistent evidence memory keep the planner grounded over long episodes.

| **Qwen3.6-Plus + QwenNav-8B** | **76.7** | **54.4** | **79.27** |

### Autonomous Driving (NAVSIM)

| Model | NC | DAC | TTC | Comfort | EP | PDMS |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| NavFoM | 97.7 | 93.5 | 92.3 | 100 | 79.6 | 84.3 |
| AutoVLA | 98.4 | 95.6 | 98.0 | 99.9 | 81.9 | 89.1 |
| ReCogDrive | 97.9 | 97.3 | 94.9 | 100 | 87.3 | 90.8 |
| ReflectDrive | 97.7 | 99.3 | 93.5 | 100 | 86.9 | 91.1 |
| **Qwen-RobotNav-4B** | **99.8** | 97.5 | **98.5** | 99.9 | 84.4 | **91.4** |

### Interface Ablation

The task-adaptive observation interface is evaluated by changing inference-time context controls on **500 VLN-CE R2R Val-Unseen episodes** with Qwen-RobotNav-4B. These ablations show that the interface is not just a formatting choice: changing the call-time configuration changes how the same model trades off long-term memory, current-scene fidelity, and path execution.

| Interface Control | Sweep Setting | Key Result | Takeaway |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Visual token budget `B` | `B=2048` to `4608`, fixed `gamma=2.0` | SR improves from **70.8%** to **74.6%**; OSR rises from **78.9%** and peaks at **82.7%** when `B=3584` | More visual context helps goal reaching, but very large context shows diminishing returns. |
| Temporal decay `gamma` | `gamma=0.5` to `3.5`, fixed `B=3072` | OSR improves from **78.8%** to **82.6%**; SR peaks at **72.5%** when `gamma=3.0` | Stronger recency bias improves current-scene resolution, but can trade off early-history context. |

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/interface_ablation.png" alt="Qwen-RobotNav Interface Ablation" width="90%"/>
</div>

This supports the core design choice of exposing context as a controllable interface. A long-horizon route-following call can allocate more tokens to historical frames, while tracking or local approach can emphasize recent observations without retraining or changing the architecture.


## 🌍 Real-World Deployment

Qwen-RobotNav is deployed zero-shot on a **Unitree Go2** quadruped robot with on-device inference via **NVIDIA Jetson Thor**, achieving **196 ms latency (5.1 Hz)** in the blog deployment. The only visual input is the Go2's built-in low-resolution camera, and the real-world experiments are conducted in previously unseen environments without environment-specific fine-tuning.

### Deployment Results

| Scenario | Setup | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fine-grained indoor control | Apartment deployment with the Go2 built-in camera and step-by-step natural-language commands | Traverses bedroom, living room, and bathroom while responding to fine-grained spatial directives. |
| 21.78 m back-and-forth VLN | Unseen exhibition hall, from living-room area to hospital room and then reverse route | Maintains landmark grounding over a long route and executes bidirectional language-conditioned control. |
| Agentic navigation | Open-ended Cotti Coffee umbrella query with planner calls to Qwen-RobotNav | Decomposes the task into sub-goals, navigates with corridor landmarks, inspects the target scene, and returns an evidence-grounded answer. |

- **Fine-grained indoor control.** In an apartment setting, the robot follows step-by-step natural-language instructions across the bedroom, living room, and bathroom, while responding to spatial directives such as stopping at a specified side of furniture or taking a detour before exiting a room.

- **Long-horizon instruction following.** In an unseen exhibition hall, the robot navigates **21.78 m** from a living-room area to a hospital room using pure language instructions, grounding the route in landmarks such as furniture, doorways, and signage. It then receives a reverse command and retraces the route back toward the starting pose, testing bidirectional spatial grounding rather than one-way route execution.

- **Agentic navigation.** For the open-ended request "check whether a green umbrella was left at Cotti Coffee," the upper-level agent decomposes the task into sub-goals, uses corridor landmarks for localization, asks Qwen-RobotNav to execute grounded navigation segments, inspects the target scene, and returns an evidence-grounded answer without human intervention.
