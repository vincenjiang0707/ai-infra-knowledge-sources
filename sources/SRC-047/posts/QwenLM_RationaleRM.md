## 📖 Overview

**RationaleRM** is a research project that investigates how to align not just the *outcomes* but also the *reasoning processes* of reward models with human judgments. We discover that generative reward models (GenRMs) and LLM-as-a-Judge exhibit **Deceptive Alignment** issues — models may reach the same final result as humans through superficial or even incorrect reasoning processes.

To address this, we propose the **Rationale Consistency** metric, which measures the alignment between the model's reasoning process and human judgment rationales. We also design the **MetaJudge** framework to compute this metric: it decomposes human and model rationales into atomic units, then performs strict one-to-one semantic matching to precisely quantify their consistency.

**Core Contributions:**

- 🔍 **MetaJudge Framework**: Decomposes human rationales into atomic units and uses LLMs for strict one-to-one semantic matching
- 📊 **Rationale Consistency Metric**: Effectively detects deceptive alignment and distinguishes frontier models (e.g., GPT-5 or Gemini 3 Pro)
- 🛠️ **Hybrid Reward Training**: Combines rationale reward (Average Precision) and outcome reward to prevent "rationale degeneration"
- 🏆 **SOTA Performance**: Achieves best results on RM-Bench (87.1%) and JudgeBench (82.0%)

## 🚨 Key Finding: The Deceptive Alignment Trap

We evaluated 19 frontier models and found two critical flaws when relying solely on outcome accuracy:

### Outcome Accuracy Cannot Distinguish Frontier Models

In the green region, although multiple models achieve similar outcome accuracy, rationale consistency clearly distinguishes stronger models (such as GPT-5, o3, Gemini 3 Pro) from weaker ones (such as Claude 3.5, GPT-4.1).

### Outcome Accuracy Cannot Detect Deceptive Alignment

The most typical example is the comparison between **o3 and o3-mini**: both have similar outcome accuracy, but o3-mini's rationale consistency is nearly 50% lower. o3-mini relies on surface cues (such as formatting, emojis) to make judgments, while o3 performs rigorous fact-checking like humans do.

> 💡 **Key Insight**: Models can make correct choices for wrong reasons. Outcome accuracy alone cannot detect this deceptive alignment.

## 📉 Training Finding: Outcome-Only Supervision Leads to Rationale Degeneration

</p>

<p align="center"><em>Training dynamics comparison: Similar outcome rewards, but significantly different rationale rewards</em></p>

The figure above shows a key finding during training: **outcome-only supervision leads to continuous decline in model-human reasoning process consistency**.

- **Left**: Both methods achieve nearly identical outcome rewards, indicating models can learn to select correct answers
- **Right**: Rationale rewards show significant divergence — without rationale consistency constraints, model rationale rewards continuously decline, ultimately **24.2%** lower than our method

This reveals the **Rationale Degeneration** phenomenon: when intermediate reasoning processes are not incentivized, models abandon high-cost evidence verification and instead rely on cheaper surface cues to achieve similar outcome rewards.

## 🏆 Main Results

We evaluate on two challenging benchmarks:

- **RM-Bench**: Evaluates model ability to distinguish subtle differences and style biases
- **JudgeBench**: Emphasizes deep judgment and logical reasoning

    └── model-high_deceptive_alignment.jsonl
```

### Step 1: Prepare Data

Input data should be in JSONL format with the following fields:
- `human-checklist`: List of human atomic rationales (reference)
- `{model}-checklist`: List of model-generated atomic rationales to be evaluated

Example:
```json
{
  "domain": "general",
  "context": [...],
  "response1": "...",
  "response2": "...",
  "human-checklist": [
    "Response 1 lacks polysyllabic rhymes",
    "Response 2's meter is inconsistent"
  ],
  "model-low_deceptive_alignment-checklist": [
    "Response A's rhyme scheme is forced",
    "Response B's rhythm feels awkward"
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Run Inference

The inference script evaluates how well each model-generated checklist item matches the human checklist:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"  # Optional, defaults to OpenAI

# Run inference
python metajudge_infer.py \
    --input-file data/helpsteer3_test_1000.jsonl \
    --output-file output/results.jsonl \
    --model gpt-4o \
    --model-be-evaluated model-low_deceptive_alignment \
    --concurrent-requests 5
```

Or use the shell script:
```bash
bash metajudge_infer.sh
```

Key parameters:
- `--input-file`: Path to input JSONL file
- `--output-file`: Path for output results
- `--model`: LLM model for semantic matching (e.g., gpt-4o, qwen-plus)
- `--model-be-evaluated`: The critic model whose checklist will be evaluated
- `--concurrent-requests`: Number of parallel API requests

API configuration (via environment variables or command line):
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `--api-key`: API key for the LLM service
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` or `--api-base`: API base URL (default: https://api.openai.com/v1)

### Step 3: Analyze Results

Compute Precision, Recall, F1, and Average Precision:

```bash
# Analyze single file
python metajudge_analysis.py \
    --input-file example/low_deceptive_alignment_infer_output.jsonl \
    --model-be-evaluated model-low_deceptive_alignment

# Analyze all files in a directory
python metajudge_analysis.py \
    --input-dir example/ \
    --sort-by recall
```

Output example:

```text
====================================================================================================
Results Sorted by RECALL
====================================================================================================
Model                                         Precision    Recall       F1           AP           Valid   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
model-low_deceptive_alignment                 0.3300       0.4297       0.3684       0.3991       10      
model-high_deceptive_alignment                0.1850       0.2242       0.1985       0.2376       10

## 📂 Dataset

We provide two datasets:

### 1. HelpSteer3 Human Checklist (Full Dataset)

**`helpsteer3_human_checklist.jsonl`** contains the complete HelpSteer3 dataset with human-annotated atomic rationales, suitable for training.

### 2. Test Set (with Model Checklists)

**`helpsteer3_test_1000.jsonl`** contains 1000 selected test samples used for testing in the paper. We provide two model checklists representing different levels of deceptive alignment:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `human-checklist` | Human-annotated atomic rationales (reference) |
| `model-low_deceptive_alignment-checklist` | Low deceptive alignment model checklist (corresponds to high Rationale Consistency in the paper) |
| `model-low_deceptive_alignment-label` | Low deceptive alignment model preference label |
| `model-low_deceptive_alignment-generated_text` | Low deceptive alignment model full generated text |
| `model-high_deceptive_alignment-checklist` | High deceptive alignment model checklist (corresponds to low Rationale Consistency in the paper) |
| `model-high_deceptive_alignment-label` | High deceptive alignment model preference label |
| `model-high_deceptive_alignment-generated_text` | High deceptive alignment model full generated text |

> **Note:** 
> - Atomic rationales were generated using GPT-5 for research purposes only.
> - The `model-high_deceptive_alignment` and `model-low_deceptive_alignment` data are provided for testing/evaluation purposes only and were not used for training.
