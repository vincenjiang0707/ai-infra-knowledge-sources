Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Qwen3.5 open model series, including Qwen3.5, Qwen3.6, and the latest Qwen3.8. Here, you can find official information about Qwen3.8, post your questions ([Issues](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3.8/issues)), and share your ideas with the community ([Discussions](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3.8/discussions)).

## Introduction

### Qwen3.8

For the first time, Qwen3.8 brings a Qwen-Max-class model to open release. Built on the architectural foundation of Qwen3.5, Qwen3.8 delivers substantial gains across coding, professional work, research, and long-horizon agentic tasks. Beyond answering harder questions, Qwen3.8 is designed to carry complex, multi-step tasks through to completion with greater reliability.

Qwen3.8 features the following enhancements:
- **Core Capabilities**: Comprehensive improvements across coding, professional work, research, and long-horizon agentic tasks.
- **Agent Execution**: Stronger autonomous planning and better handling of environment feedback, leading to more reliable end-to-end task completion.
- **Downstream Compatibility**: Broader support for popular harnesses and development tools, making it easier to integrate into your existing stack.
- **Flexible Thinking Control**: Reasoning depth can be tuned with `reasoning_effort`, and reasoning context from historical messages is retained via `preserve_thinking`.

### Qwen3.6

Building upon the fundamental breakthroughs of Qwen3.5, Qwen3.6 prioritizes stability and real-world utility. It offers developers a more intuitive, responsive, and genuinely productive coding experience, shaped by direct community feedback. This update delivers substantial upgrades, particularly in:

- **Agentic Coding:** The model now handles front-end workflows and repository-level reasoning with greater fluency and precision.
- **Thinking Preservation:** A new feature retains thinking context across conversation history, streamlining iterative development and reducing overhead.

### Qwen3.5

Over recent months, we have intensified our focus on developing foundation models that deliver exceptional utility and performance. Qwen3.5 represents a significant leap forward, integrating breakthroughs in multimodal learning, architectural efficiency, reinforcement learning scale, and global accessibility to empower developers and enterprises with unprecedented capability and efficiency.

Qwen3.5 features the following enhancements:

- **Unified Vision-Language Foundation**: Early fusion training on trillions of multimodal tokens achieves cross-generational parity with Qwen3 and outperforms Qwen3-VL models across reasoning, coding, agents, and visual understanding benchmarks.
- **Efficient Hybrid Architecture**: Gated Delta Networks combined with sparse Mixture-of-Experts deliver high-throughput inference with minimal latency and cost overhead.
- **Scalable RL Generalization**: Reinforcement learning scaled across million-agent environments with progressively complex task distributions for robust real-world adaptability.
- **Global Linguistic Coverage**: Expanded support to 201 languages and dialects, enabling inclusive, worldwide deployment with nuanced cultural and regional understanding.
- **Next-Generation Training Infrastructure**: Near-100% multimodal training efficiency compared to text-only training and asynchronous RL frameworks supporting massive-scale agent scaffolds and environment orchestration.

## Models

The official model weights are released on:
- [🤗Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/Qwen): Most LLM frameworks and applications support downloading model files from Hugging Face Hub automatically by specifying the model ID, e.g., `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`, `Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B`, and `Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B`.
  You can also download model files manually using `huggingface download` or `git clone`.
  Please follow the instructions on the model page.
- [🤖ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/organization/Qwen): For users unable to access Hugging Face Hub, we strongly recommend using ModelScope.
  For supported frameworks, you can download from ModelScope by setting environment variables, such as `SGLANG_USE_MODELSCOPE=true` or `VLLM_USE_MODELSCOPE=true`.
  You can also download model files manually using `modelscope download` or `git clone`.
  Please follow the instructions on the model page.

### Local Use

#### Hugging Face Transformers

[`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers) acts as the model-definition framework in the current open-weight LLM landscape.
It also includes functionalities for LLM inference and training. The addition of serving capabilities in `transformers` makes it much easier to integrate new models in your development.

To launch a server, simply use the `transformers serve` command:
```shell
transformers serve Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B --port 8000 --continuous-batching
```
An OpenAI-compatible API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/v1`.
See [the Serve CLI guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/serve-cli/serving) for more information.

#### llama.cpp

[`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) enables LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of hardware.
llama.cpp supports the Qwen3.5 open model series (text & vision).
Look for models ending with GGUF on Hugging Face Hub.

#### MLX (Apple Silicon)

If you are running on Apple Silicon, both [`mlx-lm`](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm) (text-only) and [`mlx-vlm`](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm) (vision + text) support the Qwen3.5 open model series. Look for models ending with MLX on Hugging Face Hub.

Also see vLLM Recipes on [serving Qwen3.8](https://recipes.vllm.ai/Qwen).

#### TokenSpeed

[TokenSpeed](https://github.com/lightseekorg/tokenspeed) is a speed-of-light LLM inference engine.
TokenSpeed can be used to launch a server with an OpenAI-compatible API service.

```shell
tokenspeed serve Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B --port 8000 --tensor-parallel-size 4 --max-model-len 262144 --reasoning-parser qwen3 --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser qwen3_coder
```

An OpenAI-compatible API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/v1`.
