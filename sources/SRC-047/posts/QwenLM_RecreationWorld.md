## Overview

RecreationWorld is a five-platform framework for studying and improving **hybrid computer-use agents** that autonomously interleave GUI exploration, implementation with coding tools, and visual verification of their own running artifacts. By framing recreation around a running reference as an executable oracle, it turns open-source applications into scalable, verifiable training experience that transfers beyond recreation, while RecreationBench provides 250 held-out tasks with reference-grounded programmatic and visual evaluation.

## Recreation workflow

Each task gives the agent a high-level request, interactive access to a running reference, and both GUI-control and software-development tools. The agent decides when to explore the reference, implement source code, build and launch its candidate, inspect the result, and revise it—forming a recurring **explore–implement–verify** loop rather than a fixed sequence of stages.

![RecreationWorld workflow: explore a running reference, implement and verify a candidate, then evaluate it with hidden functional and visual assertions.](assets/workflow.png)

The final candidate is evaluated by a frozen suite of reference-validated programmatic and visual assertions. Scoring depends on observable behavior rather than source-level similarity, so implementations remain free to use different languages, frameworks, and architectures.

## RecreationBench Results

Scores are macro-averaged within each platform and then equally weighted across platforms. Average is the unweighted mean of Prog and VLM; estimated costs assume 90% cache reads.

| Model | Prog (%) | VLM (%) | Average (%) | Prog ≥90% (% apps) | Prog =100% (% apps) | Estimated cost (USD/task) |

## Quickstart

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), then run from the repository root:

```bash
uv sync
uv run rb run --help
```

A scored run also needs a matching frozen task bundle from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Qwen/RecreationBench) or [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/Qwen/RecreationBench), a prepared execution environment, and model and judge endpoints.
Choose a platform for setup and batch runs:

| Platform | Tasks | Evaluation interface | Setup and run |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu | 50 | AT-SPI | [Linux guide](docs/providers/linux.md) |
| macOS | 50 | AXUIElement | [macOS guide](docs/providers/macos.md) |
| Windows | 50 | UI Automation | [Windows guide](docs/providers/windows.md) |
| Android | 50 | UiAutomator | [Android guide](docs/providers/android.md) |
| Web | 50 | Browser assertions | [Web guide](docs/providers/web.md) |

The canonical task index is in [`tasks/`](tasks/).

To verify the checkout, run these offline checks; they do not require benchmark data or credentials:

```bash
uv run python scripts/release/smoke_providers.py
uv run python scripts/release/smoke_runtime.py
```
