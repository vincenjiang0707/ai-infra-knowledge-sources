## 💡 Introduction

<div align="center">

<br>

**Qwen-RobotManip** is a generalizable vision-language-action foundation model built upon **Qwen-VL / Qwen3.5-4B**. It couples a vision-language backbone with a **flow-matching Diffusion Transformer action expert**, enabling continuous action generation while preserving the perception and language grounding needed for robotic manipulation.

The central principle is **alignment before scale**. Robot manipulation data is naturally heterogeneous: robot embodiments, action spaces, camera systems, coordinate frames, collection pipelines, and task distributions vary widely. Qwen-RobotManip introduces a unified alignment framework across representation, motion, and behavior so that multi-source training becomes coherent instead of conflicting.

Using only open-source robotic manipulation datasets and egocentric human videos, without proprietary data collection, Qwen-RobotManip constructs a pretraining corpus of approximately **38,100 hours** and demonstrates strong OOD generalization, instruction following, reactive recovery, and cross-embodiment transfer.

### ✨ Key Highlights

- **🔗 Three-Dimensional Alignment.** Representation alignment, camera-frame motion alignment, and behavior alignment make heterogeneous manipulation data trainable under one model.

- **🤖 Unified Cross-Embodiment Action Space.** An **80D canonical state-action representation** with per-dimension binary masks accommodates single-arm, dual-arm, dexterous hand, and mobile manipulation settings.

- **📷 Camera-Frame End-Effector Motion.** End-effector deltas are represented in the camera coordinate frame, with Camera Positional Encoding (CaPE) injecting camera geometry into the action expert.

- **🌍 Open-Source Data at Scale.** The pretraining corpus contains about **38,100 hours** of manipulation data, including **24,808 hours** of human-to-robot synthetic demonstrations across 15 embodiments.

- **🏆 Strong OOD and Real-World Performance.** Qwen-RobotManip leads OOD benchmarks such as LIBERO-Plus, RoboTwin-Clean2Rand, EBench, RoboCasa365, and RoboTwin-IF, and ranks **#1** on the RoboChallenge Table30 v1 generalist track.


## 🧠 Method

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/qwenrobot/robotmanip/images/method_v2.png" alt="Qwen-RobotManip Method" width="90%"/>
</div>

Qwen-RobotManip combines a **Qwen3.5-4B vision-language backbone** with a **flow-matching DiT action expert**. The VLM processes multi-view observations, language instructions, structured embodiment prompts, and execution context. The action expert predicts continuous action chunks through flow matching and uses a small number of Euler integration steps for low-latency control.

The model maps heterogeneous robot states and actions into a shared **80-dimensional canonical vector**. Missing degrees of freedom are zero-padded and excluded from the loss with binary masks, allowing different embodiments to share one template without forcing nonexistent joints or grippers to receive supervision.

For motion alignment, Qwen-RobotManip predicts **camera-frame delta end-effector poses**, making visually similar motions numerically closer across embodiments and coordinate systems. Camera extrinsics and intrinsics are injected through **CaPE**, while end-effector type embeddings and auxiliary flags condition the denoising process.

For behavior alignment, Qwen-RobotManip uses structured embodiment prompts and **in-context policy adaptation**. Recent observation-state-action chunks from the same episode act as an implicit description of the current embodiment and behavior profile, allowing the model to adapt without parameter updates.

  <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/qwenrobot/robotmanip/images/h2r_pipeline.png" alt="Human-to-Robot Synthesis Pipeline" width="90%"/>
</div>

The Human-to-Robot synthesis pipeline converts egocentric hand demonstrations into robot demonstrations through action retargeting, hand removal and inpainting, simulated robot rendering, and depth-guided compositing. This pipeline turns about **1,933 hours** of egocentric human video into about **24,808 hours** of robot-compatible demonstrations across **15 robot embodiments**.


## 🏆 Benchmarks

### In-Distribution Manipulation

Qwen-RobotManip matches or exceeds prior methods on standard in-distribution benchmarks, while the report emphasizes that IID results alone do not reliably measure foundation-model generalization.

| Model | LIBERO SR (%) | RoboTwin Easy SR (%) | RoboTwin Hard SR (%) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Qwen-RobotManip | 99.1 | 93.4 | 92.5 |
| **Qwen-RobotManip-Context** | **99.2** | **93.7** | **94.0** |

### Out-of-Distribution Generalization

Qwen-RobotManip is evaluated across task and scene variation, instruction following, and cross-embodiment transfer.

| Benchmark | Metric | Qwen-RobotManip | Qwen-RobotManip-Context |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| LIBERO-Plus | Overall SR (%) | 89.0 | **91.4** |
| RoboTwin-Clean2Rand | Hard SR (%) | 62.6 | **69.4** |
| EBench | Overall SR (%) | **45.6** | 43.6 |
| RoboCasa365 | Total SR (%) | **35.9** | 33.8 |
| RoboTwin-IF | Average SR (%) | **72.2** | 72.0 |

RoboChallenge Table30 v1 further tests real-world OOD generalization under platform, task, and execution complexity shifts. The generalist track spans **30 tasks across 4 robot platforms**, covering AgileX ALOHA, Franka, UR, and ARX. Qwen-RobotManip ranks **#1** with **45%** success rate and a **59.83** process score, outperforming the third-place system by **20%**.

</div>

- **Bimanual coordination.** On the 8 ALOHA tasks that require tight two-arm coordination, Qwen-RobotManip reaches **40%** average success rate, compared with **21.2%** for $\pi_{0.5}$. It is also the only model to succeed on the "pour fries into plate" task, which requires sequential stabilization, opening, lifting, and pouring.

- **Cross-embodiment pick-and-place.** Across 12 pick-and-place-centric tasks distributed over all four platforms, from single-object grasping to multi-step manipulation involving 4-5 objects, Qwen-RobotManip achieves **63.3%** average success rate, surpassing the next-best baseline DM0 (**48.3%**) by **15.0** percentage points.

</div>

- **Reactive recovery.** In real-robot trials, the policy can retry after slips or failed grasps without an explicitly scripted recovery routine, suggesting that large-scale aligned pretraining helps the model close the loop between visual feedback and corrective action.
