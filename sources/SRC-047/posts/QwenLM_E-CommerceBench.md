## Results

An agent starts with ¥100,000 and runs up to four stores for 365 simulated days.
The primary score is the **asset multiplier**, end-of-year total assets over the
opening balance, averaged over 5 independent episodes per model.

Bold values mark the best scored column. †GPT-5.5's spread is a population estimate, ¥689k on the sample estimator.
‡GPT-5.5's AnchorRatio averages three episodes, its two bankrupt runs opening no repeat order with a supplier it had already dealt with.

  <em>Capability profiles for six of the 18 models. The primary score and the six
  dimensions run clockwise from the top: profit (mean end-of-year total assets),
  negotiation (CSE⁺), fraud avoidance (BadSpend%), solvency (drawdown over peak
  total assets), efficiency (profit per tool call), execution (controllable
  return rate) and learning (AnchorRatio). Fraud avoidance, solvency, execution
  and learning are sign-flipped so that higher is better on every axis. Each
  axis is min-max normalized over the 18 model means, with whiskers over the
  five episodes and a dashed polygon at the median. No profile fills the
  polygon.</em>
</p>

The rankings diverge across dimensions. The model that ends the year with the
most assets captures a smaller share of each bargaining range than four models
below it, and routes 18.5% of its procurement spend to fraudulent suppliers
against 0.12% for the most cautious. Final assets alone therefore say little
about how an agent got there, which is why the suite reports the axes separately.

## Overview

E-Commerce Bench is a 365-day continuing task. The agent plays a merchant,
"Wang Wang", opening up to four online stores, sourcing inventory by negotiating
with suppliers, pricing and stocking products, fulfilling orders and handling
returns, with one objective: maximize end-of-year assets.

What makes the horizon bite is that nothing resets. Cash spent on inventory is
gone until customers pay and escrow settles nine days later; a supplier that
overcharged in March is the same supplier in November; and the context window
overflows long before day 365, so the agent has to decide what is worth
remembering.

Both sides of the market are **deterministic**, so an outcome difference is
attributable to the agent rather than to the environment:

- **Demand** follows a fixed multi-factor model over data desensitized from a
  real e-commerce platform: 6,886 products, 60 categories, 12 store types, a
  year-long calendar of promotions and market shocks.
- **Suppliers** decide every price through a deterministic negotiation kernel,
  seeded per (supplier, SKU, cycle). An LLM only renders that decision into
  dialogue and is not permitted to change it, so no amount of eloquence talks a
  supplier below its floor. Of 576 suppliers, 152 are fraudulent and run one of
  five scam patterns, undetectable from price alone by construction.

## Environment Setup

**Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Set a key** for the provider whose model you want to run, plus
`OPENAI_API_KEY` for the supplier NPC (see below).

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...        # provider: openai, and the NPC
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... # provider: anthropic
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...           # provider: google
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=...        # Qwen
export ZHIPU_API_KEY=...            # GLM
export MOONSHOT_API_KEY=...         # Kimi
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...         # DeepSeek
```

## Experiment Configuration

`models_config.json` holds the original 18 models from the paper evaluation, each at the
reasoning effort it was evaluated with. Pass an entry key to `--model`:

```
openai      gpt-5.6-sol · gpt-5.5
anthropic   claude-fable-5 · claude-opus-4-8 · claude-opus-4-7 · claude-opus-4-6
google      gemini-3.5-flash · gemini-3.1-pro
dashscope   qwen3.8-max-preview · qwen3.7-max · qwen3.6-plus · qwen3.5-plus
zhipu       glm-5.2-high · glm-5.2-max · glm-5.1
moonshot    kimi-k3 · kimi-k2.6
deepseek    deepseek-v4-pro
```

The paper's runs reached these models through an internal gateway; the entries
name the same models at their providers' public endpoints. Requests send no
temperature or `top_p`, and thinking is enabled wherever the family supports it.
To add a model of your own, see
[docs/model_providers.md](docs/model_providers.md).

`npc_tools` is a second, separate model — the supplier's role-play voice, by
default `gpt-4o-mini`. It only renders dialogue into natural language: every
price and accept/reject decision comes from the deterministic kernel, which the
renderer cannot override, so it does not affect the economics. Point it at any
cheap model you have a key for.

### Running Experiments

```bash
python run.py --model gemini-3.5-flash --max-days 10 --max-turns 50   # smoke test, minutes
python run.py --model gemini-3.5-flash                               # full 365-day episode
python run.py --model gemini-3.5-flash --runs 5                      # 5 parallel episodes
bash run.sh                                                          # wrapper: live plots, timestamped log dir
```

Useful flags: `--max-days`, `--max-turns`, `--runs`, `--initial-balance`,
`--max-token-capacity`, `--log-dir`. Each run writes to
`log/<timestamp>_<model>/` with per-day balances, negotiation metrics, and full
message transcripts.

Analysis of a finished run:

```bash
python evaluation/plot_daily_balance.py log/<session>/run_*_daily_balance.csv --output-dir log/<session>/
python evaluation/extract_chatbox.py log/<session>/run_0_messages.jsonl   # per-supplier dialogue
```
